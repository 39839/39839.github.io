        content: `<p>What if your child with a speech delay could receive regular, consistent, and even fun speech support in your own home—guided by the sound of your own voice? For young children with speech delays and the caregivers who support them, Dr. Amy Yeboah Quarkume is working to make this vision a reality.  Dr. Quarkume (“Amy Yeboah Quarkume, Ph.D.”) Dr. Quarkume, an accomplished scholar, data scientist, associate professor at Howard University, and director of the CORE Futures Lab, is—among a myriad of other projects—using AI in innovative ways to make speech therapy more accessible to children and their families. Her new AI-based program is called Worlds of Hello. “Worlds of Hello is an AI-powered platform that connects families with therapy, allowing them to support their child and find their voice,” Dr. Quarkume explained. “We focus on children with speech delays.” It started as a passion project inspired by her nephew, who has a speech delay, and the challenges her family faced in getting the support he needed—particularly with a shortage of speech therapists. “We all try to help him, but there’s a three-month wait on therapists, and there’s only a thirty-minute session generally a week, and we wanted more.” ( Worlds of Hello ) Seeing this issue unfold in her own family, Dr. Quarkume and a few of her like-minded students came together to build Worlds of Hello. “It is our way to allow families to create personalized lessons for their children to find their voice. So you’ll hear your mom’s voice or your dad’s voice, or you’ll see your mom’s face, your dad’s face, or a family member’s face.”  The idea was simple enough: “When we first started, we felt it was like sending an audio file to your child on a phone, they hear your voice, and they start talking,” she explained, with the primary motive to speak being the comfort of hearing a familiar voice. “What we have right now is more dynamic, more engaging. There’s storytelling, there’s gamification, there is, again, AI in there that helps parents clone their voice.”  The app includes various lessons and activities that prompt children to practice speaking. It strives to create the perfect balance between promoting speech development and gamification, with animations that make it enticing for young children. It also allows families to be actively involved in their child’s learning, and for clinicians to monitor both caregiver and child usage. Dr. Quarkume’s team now includes speech therapists who work to emulate practices used in live sessions in the digital program. ( Worlds of Hello ) Worlds of Hello also builds this sense of familiarity by accounting for linguistic diversity, particularly different accents and dialects. Its users can select from various dialects used in different parts of the country, allowing children to learn a language as they hear it around them. “So if your mom has an accent, and she wants to use her voice, there you go. If your dad has an accent, they use their voice, there you go,” Dr. Quarkume said. The goal is to expand and include other languages as well. The program is currently undergoing beta testing, a process to prepare it for future broad consumption. The team is currently offering paid testing opportunities for families with young children with speech delays and speech therapists to test both sides of the program. But the road to this point hasn’t been easy; funding has been a constant hurdle. The project has received a Phase I grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), but is still facing funding difficulties. At this moment, the team continues to search for solutions to further their research and development. Dr. Quarkume explained how difficult it is for Black women in particular to fund their businesses—less than 1% of companies founded by Black women receive venture capital or similar financial support. She also noted the challenges of data privacy, especially for children, the costs associated with software and AI development, and the environmental impact of AI. However, she is hopeful about the project’s next steps: exploring avenues to complete the research and development, resolving any remaining bugs or issues, and bringing Worlds of Hello to market. For Dr. Quarkume, it’s exciting to see the potential gains for families and the way it can support them. “It works—that children will see their family members in their learning environment and be drawn to speak and overcome their challenges, and that parents will feel comfortable contributing to their child’s learning journey, because it does take time and most parents are busy, right?” The possibility of expanding similar technology beyond pediatrics is also an exciting prospect, and she has received inquiries about doing so in areas such as geriatrics. “Voice technology has been here for a while,” she said, but described how her team wants to find its unlocked potential. “It’s just, where hasn’t  it gone that we can kind `

        content: `<p>Inside Johns Hopkins University’s IMERSE Lab, surgical robotics is entering a new frontier. From the early days of robotic assistance in minimally invasive surgery to today’s systems that can recognize anatomy, adapt as tissue shifts, and plan intricate movements with remarkable precision, the field is evolving at an extraordinary pace. At the center is a team of engineers and clinicians rethinking how human skill and machine intelligence can operate in synergy, transforming what surgery renders possible. From Sci-Fi to Supervised Autonomy From the development of robots in the early 20th century to the robotic boom of the 1980s, the idea of surgical robots belonged to the realm of science fiction. Yet by 1985, the first steps toward commercialization had begun. Surgeons adapted the PUMA 560, an industrial robotic arm originally designed for factory automation, to guide a needle during CT-guided brain biopsies. In that first successful use, the robot performed a delicate brain tissue sampling with unprecedented steadiness, demonstrating that machines could deliver precision beyond the limits of the human hand.  By the early 2000s, robotic platforms such as Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci®  had entered operating rooms worldwide. Their rise coincided with growing demand for less invasive technologies, hospital competition for technological prestige, and surgeon interest in tools that could reduce fatigue and improve precision. This convergence of clinical, commercial, and technological incentives fueled the rapid adoption of surgical robotics across the U.S. and abroad. Cleared by the FDA  in 2000 for general laparoscopic procedures - operations performed through small incisions using slender instruments and a camera - da Vinci  transformed possibilities for minimally invasive surgery. The robot’s articulated instruments restored the dexterity lost in traditional laparoscopic tools by mimicking the rotation of a human wrist, while its stereoscopic camera provided a magnified, three-dimensional view of the operative field. Together, these features gave surgeons unprecedented precision in confined anatomical spaces.  Yet for all its advances, da Vinci remains entirely tele-operated: a sophisticated extension of the surgeon's hand. It faithfully executes every console command but lacks the capacity to make independent decisions. Overcoming these limitations defines the next frontier: autonomy.  The IMERSE Lab and the Next Frontier At Johns Hopkins University, the Intelligent Medical Robotic Systems and Equipment ( IMERSE ) Lab, led by Dr. Axel Krieger, is bringing robotic autonomy into the operating room. The team is developing robotic systems that interpret complex anatomical environments, plan and adapt their actions as conditions evolve, and move beyond pre-scripted motions toward intelligent, collaborative assistance.  Achieving true autonomy demands close collaboration between engineers, computer scientists, and surgeons. The IMERSE Lab’s work bridges these disciplines, translating advances in machine learning and computer vision into practical surgical systems capable of navigating the variability and unpredictability of living anatomy with reliability, subtleties that still elude even the most advanced simulations.  Importantly, the IMERSE Lab's goal is not to replace surgeons but to amplify their judgment, reduce both the physical and cognitive demands of surgery, and ensure greater consistency in outcomes.  STAR: A First Proof of Concept Autonomous surgery first drew wide scientific attention through a series of collaborative efforts led by Dr. Axel Krieger and his colleagues at Children's National Hospital, and later continued at Johns Hopkins University. In 2016, Krieger’s team demonstrated an early open-surgery version of the Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR)  - performed through a traditional incision rather than small laparoscopic openings - which successfully carried out autonomous soft-tissue suturing  in vivo (in living tissue)  on animal models.  Six years later, the refined STAR took on a new mission: laparoscopic intestinal anastomosis - reconnecting two ends of the intestine after removing a diseased segment. This delicate task requires extreme precision, where even minute errors in suture spacing or tension can lead to leakage and serious complications.  Operating laparoscopically intensifies the technical challenge. Surgeons must operate through small incisions using long instruments and a camera, working without direct tactile feedback and within narrow visual and mechanical constraints. Achieving the precision required for secure, tension-free suturing under these conditions challenges even the most experienced hands.   The greatest obstacle, however, lies in the living tissue itself: soft organs bend, stretch, and shift with every breath, demanding sub-millimeter accuracy . To manage this, STAR  integrated several innovations: an advanced three-dimensional endoscope to reconstruct th`

        content: `<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that damages the nervous system. Patients can experience numerous symptoms, ranging from fatigue, impaired vision, and decreased motor coordination, to memory deficits and difficulties with bowel and bladder function. Despite being one of the most common autoimmune disorders in the world, with 2.9 million people estimated to suffer from the disease in 2023, there are currently no cures available for MS. Recent advances in the field, however, offer new hope for patients. One such example is the exciting work conducted by Dr. Jeffrey Huang, whose lab at Georgetown University holds a patent for a potential new MS drug.  Based out of nation’s capital, Dr. Huang and his team at Georgetown University are targeting an amino acid transporter that they recently identified, with the goal of reducing disease severity for MS patients. In this exclusive interview, Dr. Huang shares the journey that led him to his breakthrough discovery, additional successes along the way, and the path that led him to his impactful research on MS. Introduction Dr. Jeffrey K. Huang is a Provost's Distinguished Associate Professor in the Department of Biology at Georgetown University. His lab investigates the mechanisms of remyelination—a crucial repair process in brain disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS). This work has made impactful contributions toward developing therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Having served on peer review panels for major funding agencies such as the National Institute of Health (NIH), the National MS Society, and the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, Dr. Huang is a trusted and influential figure in the field of MS research.  Beyond his scientific and medical contributions, Dr. Huang’s story serves as a powerful example of how curiosity, dedication, and mentorship can guide an uncertain start towards an impactful and fulfilling career. In an interview with The Catalyst, he shares some of the pivotal moments that shaped his career trajectory, his lab’s exciting breakthroughs and discoveries, and his candid advice for students seeking a meaningful career in science. Dr. Huang’s Research Evolution: Remyelination & Multiple Sclerosis As one of the most common autoimmune diseases in the world, with no cures discovered to date, Multiple Sclerosis has been a subject of great interest in the scientific community for decades. While the initial pathological event driving MS progression involves the infiltration of immune cells into the brain and spinal cord, symptoms of the disease primarily result from a process called “demyelination,” in which immune cells destroy myelin, an important structure in the brain that coats neurons.  Myelin – Function Similar to the insulation on an electrical wire, our brain relies on a special coating called myelin to transmit high-speed electrical signals from one neuron to the next. This structure is formed by a population of cells in the brain known as oligodendrocytes, which send out extensions of their membrane and wrap them around neurons, creating dozens of insulating layers. While brain activity is primarily mediated by neurons, which send electrical signals to one another in the form of ion currents, myelin plays a key role in the process. By preventing ions from leaking out along the neuronal membrane, this protective coating ensures smooth, lag-free conduction. Myelin enables the high-speed signaling that our brain requires to rapidly respond to information from our surroundings in real time. Myelin – Formation Myelin also provides physical protection for neurons which, in contrast to oligodendrocytes, are unable to regenerate. The brain contains a large reservoir of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which remyelinate neurons in response to injury. In healthy brains, remyelination is important to re-establish normal signaling—but in certain pathological conditions, it fails over time. In MS, specifically, patients often experience cycles of demyelination and remyelination for several years. Eventually, however, they enter a progressive stage of the disease where this natural repair process fails. Dr. Huang’s Research Journey: The Beginnings When he began his PhD at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Dr. Huang originally planned to study cancer biology. His interests took a sharp turn, however, while doing a rotation with Dr. David R. Colman, where he was first introduced to the beautiful spiral wrappings of myelin. When his mentor showed him an electron micrograph image of the structure, he was mesmerized. “I was curious about how you get this beautiful structure without anyone turning it—it just forms in the brain. That's when science really hit me in the head… When I was in Dave's lab, I realized there were questions behind anything that you see, and that you could start asking questions and exploring the unknown – The challenge of not knowing the answer, but then developing a hypothesis`

        content: `<p>Through novel experiments and cutting-edge brain imaging, Dr. Sarah Shomstein reveals how our mind silently sorts the sensory chaos around us—and what it means for everyday attention.  Imagine walking through Lafayette Square in Washington, DC, on a chilly fall morning. You see the crisp blue sky hanging above, watch vivacious commuters in heels hurry past or glide by on scooters in flannel suits, and notice glossy plumes of goldenrod unfurling as they spiral upward. You hear impatient cars honking from afar, catch the chirp of hungry fledglings in their nest high up in the branches, and overhear an elderly man behind his newspaper on a bench grumbling that a hot dog now costs five dollars. Filling your nostrils is the aroma of freshly brewed French-roast coffee from a corner café, mingled with buttery croissants and, if you’re unlucky, the reek of a nearby garbage truck. Despite the chaos, your entire being is locked onto one thing—the Andrew Jackson statue you came for—so you completely don’t register a guy in an inflatable T.rex strolling through the crosswalk.  Find it hard to believe? See for yourself in the video below.  Did you miss the gorilla? If so, you’re not alone. In a 1999 psychological experiment (where this video originates) by psychologists Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons, roughly half of the viewers failed to notice the gorilla despite its continuous presence for nearly nine seconds. The experiment, famously known as “The Invisible Gorilla Experiment,” tested whether a tightly-focused goal, such as counting passes, could cause people to overlook something so blatantly obvious right in front of them. What Chabris and Simons found ran counter to conventional expectations. Rather than demonstrating an all-encompassing awareness, the findings challenged long-held assumptions about attention, upending the notion that we perceive everything around us and exposing how narrow attention can be. And while the clip is visual, the same selectivity operates in hearing and smell. Think, for example, of the croissant smell from the café as you’re standing in Lafayette Square. With your attention on the statue, your mind automatically dials down irrelevant signals, even the lure of a buttery breakfast. Psychologists refer to this phenomenon as “attentional selection”, a process by which the mind prioritizes certain sensory inputs and suppresses others, thereby allocating limited processing resources where they matter least. In other words, what we focus on, and simultaneously ignore, reflects our task priorities and thus strongly shapes what we perceive and remember. This partly unconscious filtering has been a focus of research for decades. Some research has utilized behavioral and eye-tracking measures to show that people can be steered by cues they don’t consciously register. 1,2  Recent studies combining electroencephalograms (EEGs) and pupillometry (the measurement of pupil size) have begun to track such unconscious filtering more directly. 3,4     At the George Washington University, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience Dr. Sarah Shomstein takes a complementary approach. As director of the Attention and Cognition Laboratory, she pairs behavioral tasks and standardized questionnaires with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a method that tracks blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals as an indirect index of neural activity. This combination enables her to map out the brain’s labyrinth pathways that underlie behavior, providing a deeper understanding of not only the psychological tendencies but also the neurological mechanisms of attentional selection.  Dr. Sarah Shomstein (Credit: Lily Speredelozzi/GW Today) From Medicine to the Frontier of Attention Research  Dr. Sarah Shomstein did not begin her journey intending to become a neuroscientist. As an undergraduate freshman at Carnegie Mellon University in the mid-1990s, she found herself on the pre-med track. In addition to taking courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and math, she worked part-time in a psychology lab, where she studied the frontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia in a psychiatric hospital. The lab was among the first few in the U.S. to use fMRI to study cognition, and Shomstein’s role as a research assistant gave her a front-row seat to the brain’s wonders and vulnerabilities. Fascinated but realizing she didn’t want to build a career solely around treating clinical populations, she pivoted toward understanding how a “normal” nervous system operates.  That pivot quickly became a calling. By her sophomore year, Shomstein had committed to studying cognitive neuroscience and joined a lab investigating attention and perception in stroke patients with localized brain damage, some of whom presented with visual agnosia—the irreversible loss of object recognition despite intact vision. For a curious, enthusiastic young Shomstein, “that was the most interesting thing ever.” Following a summer of intense research at NYU’s `

        excerpt: "The climate crisis's impacts are unequal. Children are more biologically vulnerable, while environmental racism—a result of historical discrimination—disproportionately harms marginalized communities.",
        content: `<p>The climate crisis is becoming an increasingly pressing global issue—and its adverse impacts aren’t affecting everyone equally. Climate change and other forms of environmental degradation pose serious development threats to children, as they are more biologically vulnerable than adults. At the same time, they also tend to disproportionately harm racially marginalized populations, which is often an ongoing result of discriminatory historical practices—a phenomenon known as environmental racism. Children in marginalized communities are thus at the center of this dangerous intersection, and those in D.C. are no exception. Children walking past an industrial facility in Brentwood, a historically Black D.C. neighborhood (Fears, 2021) Historical Background Environmental racism in the U.S. today is often a result of discriminatory housing practices that began as early as the 1930s. In 1933, the U.S. federal government established the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC) in response to the Great Depression, which created a zoning system that categorized neighborhoods across the country from desirable (or “green”) to hazardous (or “red”), which became known as redlining. Redlining led to racist policies that prevented Black people from buying homes in certain “green” areas, and highways were often built to further separate redlined neighborhoods and communities of color. Even today, formerly redlined areas have less green space, higher levels of air pollution, and higher surface temperatures than those rated “green” nearly a century ago.  Present day macro-social factors continue to promote and exacerbate racism, which is becoming even more dangerous in the context of climate change. Discrimination in zoning laws and housing markets keep people of color concentrated in the same polluted areas and make it difficult for them to move elsewhere. This further perpetuates power differences and limits these populations from being involved in decision-making about hazardous pollution sites. These areas face notable environmental hazards, such as higher heat indices, increased exposure to noise, air, and water pollution, and decreased access to resources such as food, green space, healthcare, transportation, and social services. Children are also still seeing the effects of historical redlining today; for instance, a 2020 study found that rates of asthma-related emergency room visits were 2.4 times higher for children living in previously redlined areas in eight different California cities (Nardone et al., 2020), and a 2017 study found higher levels of both indoor and outdoor air pollution in New Jersey zip codes with a majority Black population (Alexander & Currie, 2017). What makes children vulnerable? The climate crisis threatens all humans, but children are particularly at risk. Four key development factors drive this vulnerability: consumption, as children eat, drink, and breathe more per pound of body weight than adults do; contact, as children often engage in behaviors like putting their hands in their mouths; immunity, as children’s immune systems are not yet as strong as those of adults; and exposure time, given that children have more time to develop health conditions from early exposure. Children’s developing bodies also take longer to process and remove toxic materials they have ingested, meaning that pollutants remain in their bodies longer than they do in adults. Because of this, children face immediate threats like increased risk of infectious disease, exposure to extreme temperatures and weather events, and adverse mental health impacts such as PTSD and climate anxiety. Indirect effects include exposure to conflict, shortage of resources, malnutrition, or climate-driven migration. And these impacts can be deadly: the World Health Organization found that environmental hazards were responsible for 26% of global deaths among children younger than five years old in 2017. Residents from Buzzard Point, a predominantly Black D.C. neighborhood, protesting the groundbreaking of the DC United Soccer Stadium (Fulton, 2016) How does environmental racism affect children? These environmental hazards not only threaten all children, but disproportionately harm children of color and of lower socioeconomic status. These children tend to face higher levels of air pollution, as they are more likely to live in historically redlined neighborhoods. Many also live near other sources of pollution such as busy roads or factories, and walk to school or use public transportation, increasing their exposure to outdoor air pollution. They are often subject to higher levels of indoor air pollution as well, as they are more likely to live in smaller homes with more people and less ventilation; they also may not have a separate kitchen and living space, increasing exposure to cooking fuels and other air pollutants. Ingesting air pollutants can have adverse respiratory effects, varying from sickness and infections to more serious issues lik`

        content: `<p>From discovering supernovas to studying the birth of galaxies, Dr. Duilia De Mello's journey took her from Brazil to NASA in Washington, D.C. She uses the universe's oldest light to piece together our cosmic origins. But as the climate for science in America shifts, she questions whether the nation that drew her in will remain the best place on Earth to continue reaching for the stars. Introduction Dr. Duilia De Mello’s passion for astronomy inspired her to reach for the stars and even discover some of her own. But how did this accomplished Brazilian NASA researcher and physics professor make her way to DC? Dr. Duilia De Mello (Credit: Wikipedia) A Place to grow As a child, Dr. De Mello was curious about everything but could never find any answers, so she set out to discover them for herself. She sought to become an expert in the field of astronomy, which led her to pursue a Ph.D and participate in two post-doctorate programs at major telescopes located in Chile and Maryland. She even discovered a supernova in 1997 during her time at the European Southern Observatory in Chile. After completing her education, she became a professor at Chalmers University in Sweden.  A few years later, Dr. De Mello got an offer to work at NASA Goddard in Maryland. She needed a sponsor to do so, since only American citizens can work for government agencies, and Catholic University of America offered—where she has now worked for over 20 years. She is now a senior researcher at NASA and a tenured professor and vice provost at Catholic University. Dr. De Mello really likes working in DC because, “it's where all the action is.” She pointed out that when you look closely, there is a lot of research happening in and around DC, especially with all the universities and government research facilities. There are opportunities here, regardless of discipline, with organizations like NASA, the National Institute of Health (NIH), the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and much more. Dr. De Mello felt that  ending up in DC happened organically for her based on her connections and career aspirations. Quote: “working in DC was kind of a natural choice from the beginning” NASA Goddard Space Flight Center where Dr. De Mello works with her team to conduct research ( By NASA Goddard/Bill Hrybyk) Current research Dr. De Mello’s interests and education focused on galaxy formation and evolution, and she works on a multitude of projects in this area, some of which she spearheaded. Her work at NASA consists of deep space imaging using the Hubble SpaceTelescope. Her team analyzes the images and data from deep space and compares it to our own galaxy, the Milky Way, to help understand how our galaxy formed and what the formation process looked like.  Here’s how it works: it takes time for things to travel from one place to another, including light. But on Earth, light travels such small distances at such a fast speed that it appears instant to us. However, this is not the case for outer space. Even for something seemingly as close as our sun (which is about 93 million miles away), it still takes light 8 minutes to reach Earth. Now imagine looking at something a million times farther away—suddenly the light we see wasn’t produced just minutes ago, but years or even hundred of years earlier. So when you look at objects deep in the universe, you’re not just seeing incredibly far away, but also back in time! Dr. De Mello and her team use this to their advantage; when they look at data from a distant galaxy that is just starting to form, they can identify parts that are similar to the Milky Way, and use the information to piece together how it formed.  Dr. De Mello has also been studying blue blobs that result from colliding galaxies. Blue blobs are young stars that are born from the aftermath of a galactic collision. When galaxies “collide,” they don’t actually crash into each other—galaxies are filled with mostly empty space, so in reality they just slowly pass through each other. But the gravity from all the stars, planets, and other things in one galaxy can have a big impact on the other. This causes some gas to be pushed out of both galaxies, which is left in space. From the gas, stars are born.  Blue blobs captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. (Credit: NASA, ESA, and D. de Mello [Catholic University of America/GSFC]) Has America lost faith in science? Despite the success that Dr. De Mello has found in DC, she worries that her time here is coming to an end. Each year thousands of scientists immigrate to the US to seek unique opportunities—. according to the American Immigration Council, almost 25% of the STEM field is made up of foreign-born workers like Dr. De Mello. However, a recent shift in government leadership and public sentiment has drastically impacted the scientific community. Cuts in research funding, distrust in experts, limitations on what can be taught, and negative views on immigration are all starting to push talented sci`

        content: `<p>For communities plagued by pollution, science feels like something done to them, not for them. Environmental health scientist Sacoby Wilson is leading a movement to put the tools and products of research directly in the hands of the people. Empowering, Informing, and Including Communities In communities across the nation, a foul taste hangs in the air and water, a constant reminder of the industries and pollutants that surround them. Complaints of burning throats and asthma are common, but complaints to officials fall on deaf ears. With many anecdotes but little hard evidence, the struggles of communities go unaddressed while they suffer from environmental and health hazards.  The gap between what people in affected communities experience and what official data say is a battleground across the nation. For generations, scientific research has been a top-down affair, a closed-off process in the “ivory tower” of academia. Researchers with their own questions would descend on communities, collect data, and publish in a closed academic journal, overlooking the residents' most pressing concerns. A new movement is growing, allowing communities to be engaged in the research process from start to finish, elevating their valuable input. This new approach, often called community-engaged research, is championed by scientists like Dr. Sacoby Wilson, director of The Health, Environmental and Economic Justice lab (T.H.E.E.J. lab) at the University of Maryland, College Park. Dr. Wilson has worked on environmental justice through community-engaged research since his time as a PhD student at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where he studied the impacts of industrial hog farms on community health and air quality. Dr. Wilson described how engaging people most impacted by certain health hazards elevates the research being done, saying, “When we think about community engagement in general and in the research enterprise, it helps to really bring the community's voice into the work and show the value of their contextual knowledge and expertise.” He drew a sharp distinction between the motivations of research led by scientists versus led by communities, since community-engaged research can be more comprehensive and inclusive by asking questions that cover the full experience of the community and get more relevant data to drive solutions. “Their lived experience is a form of data, so they’re the experts on their everyday lives,” he said.  Empowering communities through community–engaged science will not only lead to a better impact of the research to benefit the community, but it may also help improve public trust in science. Throughout our conversation, there were many repeating themes of power differences and division in traditional research methods, and between academics and the public. “There's a lot of baked-in inequities in how we do science,” Dr. Wilson said, further elaborating how traditional research is driven in a top-down manner, with many differences in funding and power between academic institutions and community groups. These power imbalances drive a sharp divide between academics and citizens. Engaging the community in science by involving them at every step and empowering them with skills along the way can help improve communication and trust between researchers and the public, something that is lacking in the present day. Dr. Wilson pointed out that this division could be part of the reason for widespread anti-science sentiment in the US. Conducting research inspired by citizens is a way of “ground truthing lived experience,” he said.  The division Dr. Wilson described extends beyond an academic setting. There is a growing national crisis of confidence in science. Public trust in science has fluctuated in recent years, and it remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, according to a Pew Research Center poll . Only 45% of US adults say that it is accurate to describe scientists as good communicators. There is also a divide in confidence between democrats and republicans, with republicans expressing less overall trust in scientists to act in the best interests of the public.  Part of this mistrust–as Dr. Wilson alluded to–could be a lack of understanding between citizens and scientists. When communities are left out of the research of their lived experiences, they feel iced out, not understanding or feeling like they benefit from the scientific process. Additionally, when scientists are used to publishing in academic journals and using field-specific jargon, they may do a bad job of communicating their work’s importance and relevance to society.  From the Community, for the Community  One of Dr. Wilson’s most impactful areas of research involves air quality monitoring through a network of deployed indoor and outdoor air quality monitors. He collaborates with multiple groups, from community organizations and government agencies to other universities. These networks collect data to help inform and empower`

        content: `<p>Myasthenia gravis, a rare autoimmune disorder targeting the junction between nerve and muscle, has long been managed with treatments borrowed from more common diseases. While new therapies offer hope, the hunt for a targeted cure remains a formidable challenge. Leading expert Dr. Henry Kaminski guides us through the latest breakthroughs in treatment, the hurdles of drug development, and the innovative, cross-disciplinary collaborations that may finally unlock personalized care for those living with this complex condition. In recent human history, breakthroughs in medicinal research have flourished at a rapid rate, putting an end to many deadly diseases that plagued our world in the past, from smallpox and polio to COVID-19. However, much is still unknown about the development and treatment of autoimmune  diseases, due to their low prevalence and requirement for highly specialized care. Despite its rarity myasthenia gravis (MG), or “grave muscle”, is among the most well-studied muscular autoimmune disorders currently documented[A]. Henry Kaminski, a leading expert on MG, is a professor of neurology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences.  “Back when I was an undergraduate, I wanted to be a scientist. I was a complete failure on my projects, but despite that I still wanted to do this. After graduating residency, I decided to work with this MD/PhD Neurologist, who made the mistake of giving me a project to write a review article on Myasthenia Gravis. From there [it was fascinating to me], and the rest is history—it continues to be more fascinating as we grow, and now with the collaborations and capabilities I have, [there’s always more we can do].” An Attack on the Neuromuscular Junction Autoimmune diseases are characterized by unintended antibody production and activity—targeting and deactivating self-produced, necessary  proteins [ B ]. In the case of MG the antibody types, and therefore ,   targeted proteins  can vary; the overarching determinant of this disease stems from antibodies targeting proteins on the neuromuscular junction  (NMJ) within skeletal muscles [ F ]. This junction is important to facilitate the communication between the brain and the muscles—dysfunction of these junctions can give rise to many symptoms associated with MG, ranging from limited muscle strength and involvement to much more serious problems, such as respiratory failure. As general, nonspecific immunosuppression treatment has long been outdated and associated with increased risk for disease [ G ], the search for efficient targeted treatment of MG is an ongoing challenge.  “We know what produces it, but there were no treatments beyond things that we took from more common diseases to suppress the immune system.”  Current Strategies: A Double-Edged Sword Because the mechanisms of MG are pretty well known, new therapies are made to target particular pressure points of the disease. Kaminski highlights a few leading strategies that have been subject to ongoing research: FcRn inhibitors  are now commonplace in autoimmune treatment. Under normal circumstances, our bodies have the ability to recycle antibodies in the blood, protecting them from degradation [ H ]. This process occurs through neonatal Fc receptors —cell surface proteins that antibodies bind to in order to be internalized and processed, before being released back into the bloodstream. Specially developed inhibitors block  this process by acting as a competitive inhibitor of the Fc receptor , as a way to ensure malignant antibodies are no longer in circulation. Another strategy, complement inhibition , involves not the targeting of the antibody itself, but the pathway  of activation for MG. Rogue antibodies activate a series of enzymatic reactions known as the complement   system , the end result forming a protein complex that breaks down important cells within the NMJ [ K ]. Ultimately, this leads to the destruction of acetyl choline receptors in the muscle, hindering neuromuscular communication [ I ]. Complement inhibitors seek to stop this process and inhibit the pathway by targeting specific, necessary proteins for its continuation. James F. Howard Jr. Myasthenia gravis: the role of complement at the neuromuscular junction. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences . 2017 However, at the base level, these treatments are nonspecific, an issue Kaminski has attempted to solve in the past. A potential solution involves adding a protein  linked to the complement inhibitor drug that targets the neuromuscular junction , which could improve specificity; Kaminski laments on how this project was stopped in its tracks:  “We couldn’t take the next step to optimize this drug. We got a patent to develop this further, but were not able to make this transition. The key in drug development is moving from an established proof of concept to actually ramp up to the drug.”  “[FcRn and Complement inhibitors] don’t cure it, but they’re good to have. No`

        content: `<p>From documentary filmmaker to global health pioneer, Brandon Kohrt has transformed the landscape of mental health care worldwide. By combining deep cultural insight with scientific rigor and technological innovation, Kohrt is building more inclusive, effective, and scalable mental health systems for the future, especially in underserved communities across the globe.  When Observation Became Intervention Brandon Kohrt did not begin his career in a clinic or a lab, but instead behind a camera. As an undergraduate student at University of Southern California in the late 1990s, he journeyed to Nepal to document the reintegration of child soldiers into society following the country’s decade-long Maoist People’s War. Immersed in rural villages lacking formal healthcare infrastructure, Kohrt witnessed first-hand the extensive psychological trauma of war and the near-total absence of mental health support.  The resulting documentary, Returned: Child Soldiers of Nepal’s Maoist Army , premiered at Grauman’s Egyptian Theatre during the 2008 Artivist Film Festival, earning the Artivist Award for Children’s Advocacy and later winning Best Documentary Short at the Atlanta Underground Film Festival. Beyond acclaim, the project sparked Kohrt’s commitment to confronting the urgent question of what came next for the children he had followed on-screen. He came to see that their trauma was not isolated but reflected a far-reaching mental health crisis affecting entire communities.  In a country of nearly 23 million, with fewer than a dozen psychiatrists nationwide, most concentrated in the capital Kathmandu,  formal mental health care was almost entirely out of reach. Where services did exist, they relied on Western frameworks ill-suited to local realities. Kohrt recognized that importing Western psychiatric models was not only impractical but also risked reinforcing stigma and alienating those most in need of care. Effective solutions would need to leverage the existing social and cultural networks — families, spiritual leaders, and traditional healers — already integral to Nepali society.  Returned: Child Soldiers of Nepal’s Maoist Arm y Reimagining Mental Health Infrastructure Back in the United States, Kohrt shifted his focus to the urgent question that had emerged during his time in Nepal: how can mental health services be scaled in low-resource settings without losing cultural relevance?  To pursue this, Kohrt enrolled in a joint MD-PhD program at Emory University, where he studied psychiatry and anthropology. This dual training deepened his conviction that mental health is not only individual but fundamentally relational, inseparable from the well-being of families, social networks, and broader cultural systems that shape daily life. During his studies, Kohrt encountered the World Health Organization’s Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP), a global initiative aimed at closing the treatment gap in countries with limited psychiatric resources. One of mhGAP’s core strategies, known as “ task-sharing ,” offered a promising alternative to traditional specialist driven models. Rather than waiting for a system to produce more psychiatrists or psychologists, task-sharing trains lay providers such as non-specialist nurses, midwives, and community volunteers to identify and deliver front-line care for common mental conditions. Kohrt recognized that this approach aligned with what he had observed in Nepal: care delivered by trusted community members, grounded in local norms and relationships, was often more effective and acceptable than top-down clinical interventions. Kohrt became both a practitioner and evaluator of this strategy. In a 2025 scoping review he co-authored, Kohrt and his colleagues examined dozens of task-sharing programs across diverse global contexts. The results  were striking: beyond expanding access to care, task-sharing often elevated the social status of community health providers and increased their sense of self-efficacy. These shifts helped embed mental health services into the everyday fabric of community life, creating sustainable, culturally relevant care networks in places where formal systems had long fallen short. To further evaluate task-sharing operations in practice, Kohrt joined Ugandan colleagues on a landmark cluster-randomized trial of Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy  (IPT-G), a 16-session, evidence-based intervention originally developed to treat depression. Delivered by trained lay counselors, IPT-G helps participants link mood changes to life events and develop strategies for managing interpersonal stress. The results were dramatic: before treatment, 86% of participants met diagnostic criteria for major depression; four months later that figure had fallen to 6.5% in IPT-G villages compared to 54.7% in controls. The 79% relative reduction was sustained six months later, setting a new global benchmark for psychological interventions delivered by non-specialists in low-resource setti`

        content: `<p>Rebecca Katz’s plan to volunteer in India was unraveled by a severe illness that doctors in the U.S. struggled to diagnose. After eight months, they found the cause: a rare pathogen once weaponized by the U.S. military. The surreal experience would change everything, leading her to become an expert on her own disease and discover a new calling at the intersection of public health and national security. A Timely Intersection of Public Health and National Security On September 10, 2001, a young Rebecca Katz, a public health doctoral student, submitted a paper outside the typical realm of classic epidemiology — Biological Weapons as a Public Health issue — a topic that was not widely covered at the time.  However, within less than a year, following both the attacks on 9/11 and the Anthrax Attacks, Katz’s interest in the intersection of public health and national security was no longer a science-fiction concept, but a part of a burgeoning field of medical research.  In her career since, Dr. Katz has demonstrated incredible efficacy for tackling critical issues ranging from biosecurity and urban planning to pandemic preparedness and disease outbreak emergency responses. The Catalyst had a chance to sit down with her and take a deep dive into her career and insights, spanning from governmental to academic work.  From Global Health to National Security Katz’s career, like many, began with ambitions that looked quite different from where she ultimately landed. Raised in a family deeply rooted in public health, dinner table conversations didn’t revolve around investment banking or law school applications, but instead around health, equity, and the medical systems that shape people’s lives.  “I really thought I wanted to do a kind of resource allocation for global health policy,” Katz said. “I was going to be a health economist and study things like the impact of access to clean water.” However, before jumping into graduate school to pursue this goal, Katz had an itch for something else: travel. Determined to immerse herself in the kind of global work she hoped to one day lead, she convinced her parents to support a year-long volunteer trip to India.  “I was going to spend a year doing volunteer work.” Katz said. “The plan was to spend the first six months in southern India working helping out in maternal and child health clinics and then spend the last six months volunteering for Mother Teresa.” But that plan unraveled when Katz fell gravely ill. After just a few months, she was forced to cut her trip short and return to the U.S., where doctors struggled to diagnose her. For eight months, she remained sick while medical teams searched for answers. Ultimately, they discovered she had contracted a rare pathogen that had once been weaponized by the U.S. military in the 1950s as part of its former offensive biological weapons program.  This experience, harrowing and surreal, would change everything, she said.  While enduring her illness, Katz began her Master’s in Public Health at Yale University, choosing the school not just for its academics, but for its access to top-tier doctors to treat her illness. She found herself in a strange dual reality. “I was discovering the field of epidemiology… And I was also becoming really smart on my own disease,” Katz said. “If you have the intellectual capacity to do so, you have to become your own advocate.” In the process of becoming an expert in her own disease, Katz stumbled  upon a body of literature about biological weapons and biodefense, topics that had not yet entered the mainstream of undergraduate study. Her experience gave her a uniquely visceral connection to the subject. With a background in policy, economics, and epidemiology, she saw a new convergence of disciplines: national security and global health. Though there were few formal paths to follow in this emerging field, Katz couldn’t shake the feeling that this was where she was meant to be, she said. She began attending niche meetings, often the only woman in the room, and usually the youngest by far, slowly carving out space in a field that hadn’t yet fully formed.  Pioneering a New Field in the Wake of National Crises By the time Katz decided to pursue a PhD in 2000, she had a clear idea of what she wanted to study: the intersection of disease and security. Most schools didn’t quite know what to make of her proposal, but Katz pushed forward, undeterred. Eventually, a former dean from her program at Yale, who had now moved to Princeton, encouraged her to pursue her graduate studies within their School of Public and International Affairs (formerly the Woodrow Wilson School). There, Katz had the opportunity to combine courses in Epidemiology and National Security, and would soon be writing about biological weapons as a public health threat — inadvertently submitting one of her exam papers on September 10, 2001. “The thing everyone had been humoring me about, well, it became a real thing after 9/11 and the Anthrax`

        content: `<p>For innovator Scott Sklar, renewable energy is about more than climate—it’s about human survival. From powering life-saving medical clinics to designing farms that grow crops under solar panels, his work blends creative design with practical solutions. In this interview, Sklar explains his vision for an \"elegant\" and accessible energy future for everyone. Introduction A building powered entirely by renewable energy, lights, appliances, and climate regulation systems running fully off-grid without fossil fuels might sound like a futuristic idea. For Professor Scott Sklar, it’s long been reality. His career began in the 1970s, a decade at the forefront of American energy policy and the rise of an environmental movement.  Scott Sklar has dedicated his career to advancing renewable energy innovation from his early advocacy work with renewable energy to his current roles as the Sustainable Energy Director of GWU's Environment & Energy Management Institute  and the Director of George Washington Solar Institute . Heightened environmental awareness during the 1970s in the United States sparked his passion for sustainability, he said, with the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act reshaping the nation’s priorities. His work includes numerous notable projects, ranging from solar panel installations in Singapore to solar panel-based farms in Washington, D.C. These groundbreaking projects make Sklar’s principles clear: energy should be elegant, efficient, and accessible. Today, he continues to inspire the next generation of sustainable innovators while actively promoting the integration of efficient energy, renewable sources, and creative design within his teaching.  Early Days and Motivations Between the 1970s and early 80s, the United States saw a rise in environmental awareness and activism while facing multiple major energy crises. In both 1973 and 1979, geopolitical instability in the Middle East led to disruptions in Arab and Iranian oil exports. While working as a legislative aide to New York Senator Jacob K. Javits, Sklar recalled that he, along with most members of Congress at the time, lacked knowledge of the energy industry. Although Sklar acknowledged the challenge of tapping into the country’s renewable resource opportunities without access to modern technology, he was motivated by the obvious need for renewable energy, he said.   “No one’s going to interfere with your sunlight, your wind, your water, your heat... It was an inexhaustible supply,” Sklar said. “It couldn’t be controlled by anyone.” For Sklar, this independence was a driving force. He realized that traditional energy industries, such as oil and gas, didn’t want to see these new technologies developed as they sought to keep their monopoly over the energy market. This pushback was just another motivator for Sklar to pursue renewable energy, develop clean power, and expand awareness. The Potential of Energy Efficiency Energy efficiency isn’t just a technical approach but one that lays the groundwork for sustainable design, aesthetics, and innovation. However, before innovation can take place, Sklar emphasizes the importance of reassessing the energy we currently consume to prioritize efficiency and accessibility.  “I don’t want us to go 100% solar, I want us to go 100% maximum energy efficiency,” Sklar said. “It’s always less expensive to save energy than generate it from any source.”  In 1995, Sklar founded  The Stella Group, Ltd,  now a global business with the goal of  “elegant integration,” which encapsulates the blending of energy efficiency, all renewable energy sources, and various forms of energy storage. Now, as a professor at the George Washington University's Sustainable Urban Planning Master of Professional Studies and Graduate School of Professional Studies, he teaches this philosophy in his courses, such as “Energy Resources”  and “Renewable Energy & Critical Infrastructure.”   When asked specifically about solar power, Sklar explained that solar panels stand out among other forms of clean energy as they have no moving parts at all; they are elegant, still, and unique.  “Even in the desert we grow food,” he explained. “There is sunlight everywhere.”  It is ubiquitous in our society and presents itself as a static technology, as Sklar depicted. Solar panels can be integrated almost anywhere, from rooftops and roadways to parking lots and bus stop awnings, demonstrating their flexibility and potential for new design. This constant opportunity for innovation is why Sklar continues to fuel his passion for sustainability by continuing to teach and research the field.  Creative Side of Renewable Energy + Benefits   The integration of creativity, aesthetics, and renewable energy is transforming modern architecture. Sklar’s work in Singapore — where he integrated printed solar panels  into building facades to capture a more creative look — highlights this trend. A captivating factor, he added, was the ability to integrate renewable energy`

Developed at MIT, his widely cited theory links our mental lexicon (words) to declarative memory (facts/events) and mental grammar (rules) to procedural memory (skills). This framework, derived from studying neurological patients, offers key insights into language processing, disorders, and learning. Architect of the Declarative/Procedural Model Michael T. Ullman, Ph.D.,  is a professor in the Department of Neuroscience at Georgetown University and director of the Brain and Language Lab, which researches the neurocognitive bases of language and memory. While earning his doctorate in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the early 1990s, Dr. Ullman proposed the declarative/procedural (DP) model, a theoretical framework that provides key insights into the neural bases of language learning and use. His work is widely cited and has applications for the study of the neurocognition of language, memory, and other cognitive domains. Dr. Ullman’s Path: The Road to Neuroscience Dr. Ullman’s interest in science stems from his childhood experiences. “When I was a kid I was always interested in nature and science. My best friend’s father, in San Francisco, was an early geneticist, and I thought, ‘Oh, genetics would be cool,’” he said. “When I went to Harvard, there was no genetics major, but there was a biochem major — the closest I could get — so I majored in that at first.” But after beginning his studies, he said, “I just didn’t enjoy being in a lab with Petri dishes; it wasn’t my thing.” After his sophomore year, Ullman took four years off of school to help start up a computer company and then travel internationally. He then returned to Harvard. However, he switched his major to computer science, with a focus on cognitive science and language. He initially hoped the field would prove useful in launching another company, this time in machine translation.  After delving deeper into the science, though, Dr. Ullman decided to instead pursue a Ph.D. at MIT, where he began studying language under the mentorship of Dr. Steven Pinker, a renowned psychologist in the field of psycholinguistics. Although fascinated by his mentor’s cognitive approach to language, Dr. Ullman sought to study the neurobiological mechanisms of language. With guidance from both Dr. Pinker and another mentor, Dr. Suzanne Corkin, Ullman began to study patients with neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases. These conditions primarily impaired different regions of the brain, offering a unique window into how language is processed neurologically. It was during this research that he developed the DP model. Foundations of Memory: Declarative and Procedural Systems To understand the DP model, it is necessary to understand the two different types of memory at play in the human (and animal) brain. Psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists have long classified learning and memory into two main categories: declarative memory and procedural memory. Declarative memory includes the learning and memory of information that is consciously known and can be voluntarily declared, such as hard facts and events. Procedural memory, which underlies the non-conscious learning and retrieval of skills, oversees learning activities like riding a bike or typing without looking down at the keyboard. Researchers have found that these two memory systems operate in distinct regions of the brain: while declarative memory primarily involves structures in the medial temporal lobe such as the hippocampus, procedural memory largely involves the basal ganglia. These two “classes” of memory are the focus of the DP model. Formulating the Declarative/Procedural Model The DP model posits that the brain encodes different components of language in different regions of the brain, corresponding to the pre-established memory systems associated with declarative and procedural memory. Previous research established two main components of language. First, there is the mental lexicon. This refers to the collection of words that exist in human mental repertoire — essentially, the connections the brain has made between a group of sounds (e.g., ca-ta-list) and their meaning (e.g., your favorite student magazine/a substance that increases reaction rates). The second component is mental grammar. This refers to the operations your brain performs — automatically in a first language — to communicate using the mental lexicon. For example, most native English speakers would not have to think twice before saying “I ate an apple” when referring to a past event, versus “I’ll eat an apple” in reference to the future. As Dr. Ullman analyzed the results of his experimental study participants, he observed striking contrasts in the types of language impairments seen across different neurologica`

        content: `<p>In an era of growing skepticism and polarized discourse, clear science communication is more vital than ever. We sat down with Holden Thorp to explore how one of the world’s leading science journals navigates this challenge. Join us as he reflects on his journey and the evolving role of scientific storytelling. Background In a time where trust in science is eroding and public discourse grows more polarized, accurately and effectively communicating new discoveries is becoming increasingly important for progress. Science communication is not only essential to spread information in a way that excites and informs people on the world around us, but to maintain a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and innovative scientific environment. Holden Thorp, the editor-in-chief of  Science Magazine , has taken on the role to mediate the efflux of such discovery, giving him a unique perspective on how science and related communication can be approached. Career trajectories can evolve unexpectedly—rather than following an idealized course, Dr. Thorp notes that he \"didn't set out to be an editor in chief at Science .\" His career has spanned academia and leadership: first, as a laboratory researcher and associate professor at North Carolina State University; later, as Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and today, as both a professor at George Washington University and head of one of the highest impact science journals in the world. The Communication Conundrum A predisposition towards communication that is commonly held within the scientific community is that those who communicate science must also be experts in the laboratory. The traditional academic hierarchy often privileges research credentials over communicative abilities, an ideology that—as the United States continues to embrace anti-intellectualism—must be challenged. Thorp addresses this as a fatal flaw for science communicative efforts today: “Why does a great explainer need a pipette? If someone is good at explaining things to people, asking questions, understanding how science affects their lives—we need them to be doing all of those things, whether they’re also good in the laboratory or not.” Constructing restrictions to how scientific knowledge can circulate only succeeds in gatekeeping necessary paths that the public would otherwise take advantage of. Science communication, as a whole, exists not as a way to educate the general public on certain scientific topics—it is expressed as a way to excite  and get people engaged  in science; Thorp emphasizes that the path of treating science communication merely a vector for educational purposes has its faults: \"Why should people learn science if they have a lot of other things to do? It would make for better citizens—but we’d have better citizens if people learned a lot of things, not just science.\" Bridging the Publication Gap To move forward, it's incredibly important to maintain the flow of information through engagement with platforms that expand science communication. Broader access to science is achieved through publishers such as Science, PNAS , Cell , and more. The role that these publishers play has never been to serve as mass communicators to the general public; instead, they were built to validate, archive, and advance scientific discovery, taking on immense responsibility to facilitate communication between researchers. \"It’s important when you talk about science communication to understand what Science’s role is. We are not in the business of communicating science to the general public—we are a publication for scientists.\" As the demands for transparency, accessibility, and public engagement with science have grown, this traditional model has revealed its limitations, raising urgent questions about how the scientific enterprise can and should interact with the wider world. Thorp makes an important distinction: scientific journals exist primarily to facilitate communication between researchers, not to popularize findings for a lay audience. It's a necessary role, but not a complete solution to the communication gap.  DC's Role in the Future The solution to help solidify an integral role for science communicators in the coming years stems from Washington DC, the center of discourse for the attack on higher education—as well as the center for the world’s most prestigious institutes and facilities including the NIH, National Academy of Sciences, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and more. “DC has always been a center for science, it’s where most of the scientific societies are located, including mine. It’s where the NIH and many other national labs are, including several excellent research universities and hospitals—when you put all those things together, it’s one of the places that (is really great for science). It’s exciting.  The responsibility to bridge this gap doesn't fall only to journalists, doctors, or research specialists; it belongs to all thos`

        content: `<p>Dr. Song Gao of Georgetown University reveals how bridging atmospheric chemistry and environmental policy can drive real-world sustainability. In this article, Gao discusses his transformative journey from synthetic chemistry to investigating the impacts of aerosols on climate change and the ozone layer. Drawing on lessons from the Montreal Protocol and its innovative integration of science with policy, he highlights the critical need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Gao’s insights underscore that only by aligning scientific breakthroughs with pragmatic, flexible policies can we effectively combat the escalating challenges of global environmental degradation. Forest Fire, Wildfire burning tree in red and orange color. Photo by yelantsevv From fires and floods to unprecedented scalding temperatures in worldwide locations, global climate change is becoming an increasingly pressing issue. The scientific community must find ways to address it. Despite the already-palpable implications, factors such as technological advances, convenience, and political motives all impede on the ability to mitigate the accumulating damage to the environment. While societal change can be idealized at the individual level, the urgency of global climate change demands pragmatic initiative and creativity to implement structural changes. In recent years, Professor Song Gao from Georgetown University’s Department of Chemistry has worked to battle environmental systems’ damage and promote sustainability on a broader scale: international policy. From Synthetic Chemistry to Atmospheric Chemistry Throughout his undergraduate studies, Dr. Gao was primarily focused on synthetic chemistry. With a long-held passion for the environment, though, he pursued polymer synthesis, seeking to develop cleaner materials for energy storage. When he began his search for a graduate program, though, his interests drew him to PhD advisors at the University of Washington, and later his postdoctoral mentors at Caltech, to work on broader environmental science issues — in particular, atmospheric chemistry. There, Dr. Gao began researching the effects of aerosols on air pollution and the climate. While scientists had understood some of their harmful effects on air quality, they were just beginning to decipher the climate impacts of organic aerosols, especially, in both reflecting sunlight (a direct impact) and influencing the formation of clouds (an indirect impact). The Montreal Protocol and Policy Influence While Dr. Gao’s focus on air pollution and climate change has remained strong, a pivotal encounter in 2016 inspired him to consider incorporating a new angle to his work. A group of science-based policy makers asked Dr. Gao to write a review article on stratospheric ozone depletion and its implications on the regulation of chlorofluorocarbons, better known as CFCs. These molecules, which have been widely used as refrigerants, coolants and fire extinguishers since the 1940s, were discovered to play a massive role in the destruction of the ozone layer in the 1970s — a finding so consequential that it won Crutzen, Molina, and Rowland, the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Due to their stable C-F and C-Cl bonds, CFCs are mostly inert in the lower atmosphere and resistant to degradation efforts. Upon traveling to the upper atmosphere, however, the sun’s ultraviolet radiation breaks these covalent bonds. The resulting Cl and Br radicals deplete the earth’s ozone layer, inhibiting its function of filtering the most cancerous and dangerous wavelengths of ultraviolet light from reaching biological life on earth’s surface. The Rowland-Molina theory of ozone depletion. As awareness of their harm grew, the United Nations signed the Montreal Protocol in 1987 to phase out the use of CFCs. Often considered the UN’s most successful international agreement, the Montreal Protocol has eliminated approximately 99% of ozone-depleting substances in the environment.  Following that initial collaboration with science policymakers, Dr. Gao became aware of the massive potential for widespread influence by incorporating clever policy into scientific work.   “I realized that for science to truly improve society and safeguard the environment, it must interface with policy effectively,” he said. “That realization has influenced my approach ever since.”  Although rooted in science, environmental policy — as with everything related to government affairs — is strongly influenced by politics. In Chemical Transformations in the Environment , a course Dr. Gao teaches at Georgetown, he highlights “the three Ps” that underlie effective environmental policy: people, planet, and profit.  “If one aspect is ignored, the entire system becomes unworkable. If policies or solutions negatively impact people’s livelihoods or cause economic losses, they won’t be accepted. If, however, the focus is solely on profits and politics while polluting the environment, that’s unsustainable. And if we protect th`

        excerpt: "Tyler Wyka bridges engineering, sustainability, and global collaboration to drive real-world solutions for a changing planet.",
        content: `<p>Tyler Wyka (GWU SEAS BS ‘24, MS ‘25) stands at the crossroads of engineering, sustainability, and global change. As a Mechanical Engineering graduate student at George Washington University, his work spans the technical frontiers of decarbonizing energy systems while fostering international collaborations that address the pressing challenges of climate change. From his research in the Leblanc Laboratory — where he models the performance of alternative fuels in aero-derivative gas turbines — to his hands-on efforts helping communities build climate-resilient infrastructure in Sierra Leone, Wyka embodies the modern engineer: a connector of disciplines, a catalyst for innovation, and an advocate for pragmatic change. His journey, shaped by curiosity, collaboration, and a commitment to impact, continues to inspire a new generation of engineers to embrace a broader responsibility—not just to advance technology, but to create a future worth building. Introduction: Pioneering Sustainable Innovation Tyler Wyka is a current first-year Mechanical Engineering graduate student at the George Washington University School of Engineering & Applied Science (SEAS), whose work explores the potential application of alternative energy technologies in the development of new sustainable practices. Outside of the Leblanc Laboratory, Wyka additionally works directly with organizations like the Association for Energy Engineers and the Advanced Energy Group to drive a culture-oriented change in how we think about the sustainable transition. His belief in pragmatic change does not stop at GW, he said, as he also works directly with international partners in Sierra Leone and is looking to expand global collaboration to support communities of all kinds. “The US has benefited from an age of prosperity using fossil fuels to build our country… There are countries around the world not as fortunate. It feels right that we should do what we can to help.” Wyka exemplifies the qualities of a modern engineer, blending technical expertise with a broader understanding of policy and sustainability. Wyka’s story also represents the values of child-like wonder that every scientist can unlock inside themselves. And above all, he wears a smile every single day. The Big Bang On paper, Sierra Leone and New Jersey have almost nothing in common. However, Tyler Wyka eventually found himself working in both, helping to bring change from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Growing up in a small town in New Jersey as the son of a politician and an activist, Wyka often attended his father’s speeches on political reform and Garden State equality marches organized by his mother. There, Wyka developed his sensibility for the wider political world and the importance of upholding his two most defining traits to this day: curiosity and collaboration. “[My parents] instilled in me a core value to never accept the status quo if you have the power to do something,” Wyka said. His curiosity was not far behind. As a young teenager, Wyka’s favorite activities involved watching science documentaries and reading, usually focusing on space exploration or the cosmos. At age 13, Wyka attended a viewing of a Hubble Space Telescope documentary at the Jersey City Liberty Science Center. Amazed at the starry imagery and the vast depths of the universe, Wyka felt a newfound gratitude for the Earth’s existence in the cosmos, he said, and left the theater inspired. “I walked out of that big IMAX dome a changed person, in awe of my place in the Universe,” Wyka said. Being both curious about the cosmos and Congress, it was a no-brainer for Wyka to attend GWU to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, allowing him to pursue both his dreams of achieving political change and technological advancements, he said. The Catalyst During his second year of undergraduate study, Wyka joined the Design Build Fly Team, a club dedicated to constructing aircraft and attending national design competitions to showcase talented engineers. Through his experience constructing wings and analyzing flight patterns, Wyka began to envision his future at a company like NASA or SpaceX, he said, where he could achieve his lifelong dream of helping humanity reach beyond the stars. Somewhere along the way, however, he had an epiphany—one that would alter his trajectory. He realized that while the cosmos may be a vast and untapped domain, the true miracle wasn’t beyond the atmosphere; it was here, on Earth. The planet itself, a delicate and improbable oasis in the cold expanse of the universe, would be a much more rewarding problem to work on, he said. “It really is a beautiful science,” Wyka said. “Working on the environment is a much more interdisciplinary project. It’s not just the technology, but the communication and acceptance of that technology.” With this new sense of purpose, Wyka immersed himself in sustainability research at GW. He joined the Leblanc Laboratory  in 2021, w`

        excerpt: "Evolution shapes life, but its genetic origins remain a mystery. How do tiny DNA changes create stunning adaptations? The answers lie in...",
        content: `<p>As geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky once said, “nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution,” but what is there to say when even the framework evolution is built on doesn't make sense? As a species, humanity has only begun to peel back the film covering the mysteries of evolution; ecological surveillance allows for the understanding of the interplay between an organism and its environment, elucidating why certain traits are selected for in nature. However, the genetic   origins   of such selected traits are often unknown—leaving many scientists fascinated on how changes in the genome give rise to evolutionary novelty.   To explore these unknowns, Dr. Luca Livraghi  studies the colorful and diverse patterns on the wings of butterflies. These evolutionary canvases boast strong visual evidence of selection, making butterflies an effective system for studying how changes in the genome lead to ecological adaptation. This work in particular encapsulates multiple sub-fields of biology, stitching together population genetics—which heavily relies on statistical analyses to pinpoint regions of DNA that show high levels of variability within a given population—and evolutionary developmental genetics, which attempts to make sense of evolutionary change by uncovering the genetic mechanisms responsible for producing novel traits in a species. Dr. Livraghi, who is trained as an evolutionary biologist, currently works at George Washington University as a Postdoctoral Researcher to understand these mechanisms, peering into the world of silvered wing patterns in Speyeria mormonia  butterflies. Image Credit:   Photo by Jerrry G, licensed under an Education License. Dimensions: 5000 x 3321px. \"The butterfly system itself is an incredible way to measure diversity; on a phenotypic level, you have scorable natural variation within populations that is very easy to get at experimentally. Because butterflies are so variable, you can easily track phenotypically associated genetic variants and see how they change over space and time.\" A characteristic analysis often utilized in this field is the Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). Through inputting the genetic information of groups of individuals displaying a wide range of phenotypes, the GWAS searches through the entire population’s genome, giving information on small differences, or polymorphisms, in DNA sequence between each subject. A successful GWA experiment can accurately identify a single location across DNA samples with high levels of polymorphism—meaning there are unmatching nucleotides between individuals with different phenotypes at that specific location. This data can be used to conclude that, for example, a fish with red scales has a mutation in a certain area while a fish with blue scales doesn’t, explaining their differences in morphology. For Dr. Livraghi, conducting a GWAS was just the beginning of a series of comprehensive experiments to further confirm the involvement of the gene opti x   in the repression of silver colored scales in the wings of Speyeria mormonia, a North American orange and silver butterfly. Previously identified as a master regulator of eye development in Drosophila  fruit flies, optix  has been found to take on a different role in the wings of butterflies, acting as a genetic light switch for coloration and patterning (1). This epitomizes the central pillar of evolutionary development, showing how the genetic regions surrounding certain genes can become   hotspots   of evolutionary diversity, as slight changes in gene expression opens up an abundance of potential pathways for further evolution to tread upon.  To examine closer, Dr. Livraghi performed a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) experiment to target and fluorescently tag optix  mRNA transcripts, visualizing their location within the tissue through a microscope. Fluorescent stainings are able to determine how and when a gene may perform its function. Results found that at ~50% pupal development, optix  is absent in presumptive silvered spots on the wings, indicating it may work to repress the silver scale state.  “The way that optix has picked up this role in butterflies is unclear. We’re not sure what the ancestral role of this gene was, but even though it acts as a regulator of eye development in Drosophila, it doesn’t mean it was necessarily ‘co-opted’ [re-used] towards a pattern regulation gene in butterflies. In CRISPR knock-out individuals, we don’t see any effects in the eye, so the hypothesis is shaky—optix is definitely pleiotropic, it’s unclear and unlikely that it’s been co-opted from an eye development role.” Dr. Livraghi worked to confirm these findings through utilization of RNA interference (RNAi) gene ‘knockdown’, which gives insight into an organism’s phenotype if it didn’t   have  a certain gene during crucial periods in its development. Through the introduction of a silencing RNA species into the cells of the developing pupal wing, researche`

        content: `<p>Dr. Hawdon’s Winding Path to Parasitology Dr. John Hawdon (photo from The Hawdon Lab ) As a young boy with a love for animals and biology, veterinary science seemed like the natural choice for Dr. John Hawdon. However, as he advanced in his collegiate studies, he found himself captivated by something else entirely. In the 1970s, molecular biology captured his attention through its cutting-edge transformation of the field of biological research with breakthroughs in gene cloning and recombinant DNA. However, as a senior, Dr. Hawdon had already declared an animal science degree.  With little time to spare, he decided to get creative and reached out to a research lab, only to learn that a prerequisite course stood in his way. Not one to shy away from a challenge, Dr. Hawdon completed the requirement and secured a position in the lab, hoping to gain hands-on experience to strengthen his graduate school applications for molecular biology. But life, like science, doesn’t always go as planned, and his applications were met with rejection. Forced to pivot, Dr. Hawdon took a teaching job at a proprietary technical school—not an obvious stepping stone into research, but it paid the bills. His schedule was relentless, teaching five courses a day, five days a week, but in the midst of that relentless schedule, fate quietly intervened. One of the courses he taught was parasitology, and those parasites were … interesting. For Dr. Hawdon, these organisms pointed to a field rich with questions waiting to be answered. In the meantime, after two years of persistent effort in pursuit of research, Dr. Hawdon landed a position at the University of Pittsburgh, where he worked with C. elegans , a microscopic nematode, or roundworm making waves in biological research. Through this research, Dr. Hawdon realized his true interests lay in worms with direct consequences for human health, and just like that, his passion for parasitology clicked into focus. With a renewed sense of determination, Dr. Hawdon pursued graduate studies in parasitology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he met Peter Hotez, a rising figure in vaccine development for parasitic diseases. Their collaboration led Dr. Hawdon to a postdoctoral position at Yale University’s MacArthur Center for Molecular Parasitology, and soon after, he became an Associate Research Scientist in the Medical Helminthology Laboratory in the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at Yale. Nine years later, he joined George Washington University, where he would carve out his own niche in the field.  With the support of his first independent grant, he pivoted from vaccine research and leaned into the molecular mechanisms of parasitic worms and their impact on human health. Over time, his work has helped shape the field of parasitology, inspiring a new generation of scientists. Reflecting on this, Dr. Hawdon calls it “a piece of big luck,” but more than luck, it was his persistence, adaptability, and readiness to follow wherever science led him. When asked what piece of advice has guided his career, Dr. Hawdon shared his personal take on Louis Pasteur’s famous words:  \"Serendipity favors the prepared mind.\"  Looking at his journey, it’s hard to disagree. Tackling a Growing Threat: Anthelmintic Resistance Today, Dr. Hawdon’s research focuses on tackling one of parasitology’s most pressing challenges: anthelmintic resistance. Anthelmintics, or anti-parasitic drugs, have historically been highly effective in treating helminthiasis—infections caused by helminths or parasitic worms—eliminating about 99%  of susceptible helminths. However, misuse of anthelmintic drugs in agriculture and human medicine has fueled the emergence of drug-resistant strains, posing a serious threat to both human and animal health. The consequences are especially dire within the livestock industry. Sheep farmers, for example, have long heavily relied on deworming treatments to prevent helminthiasis in their livestock. However, in some regions, the misuse of anthelmintics has spurred the evolution of resistant nematodes, devastating  sheep farms worldwide. This raises concerns that, without alternative strategies to control resistance, conventional livestock farming could become unsustainable. Dr. Hawdon’s lab is at the forefront of understanding the genetic mechanics driving resistance. In a 2024 publication , his team characterized a naturally occurring strain of Ancylostoma caninum , a canine hookworm, resistant to three major classes of anthelmintics and identified genetic mutations associated with the resistance. The lab also observed altered larval activation responses in the resistant strains, suggesting changes in the signaling pathways involved in the activation process. These findings may inform future strategies for managing drug-resistant hookworm populations.

        excerpt: "Working in DC lets Dr. Brent Harris drive medical changes. His neuropathology, ALS research, and advocacy significantly help countless lives",
        content: `<p>The position of working in the Capital of the United States offers unparalleled opportunities for those who want to effect change in medicine. Dr. Brent Harris is a physician-scientist whose work in neuropathology, brain sampling, and ALS has helped millions of Americans. His reach extends beyond traditional clinical care; his development of Brain Banks and promotion of legislation for ALS research has allowed Harris to leave a lasting mark on neurodegenerative disease research. It is pivotal to understand how Harris’ proximity to the nation’s capital has facilitated his ultimate goal as a Physician: to improve the lives of patients.     Who is Dr. Brent Harris? Dr. Brent Harris is a Professor of Neuropathology at Georgetown University, and an Adjunct Associate Professor at both George Washington University and Howard University, whose current work focuses on neurodegeneration and the underlying influence of glial-neuronal relationships in the development of neurological diseases. From an early age, Harris loved both science and medicine and decided to pursue both, he said. As a physician-scientist, Dr. Harris’s work ranges from brain tissue lab research to extensive patient care. After completing his MD/PhD at Georgetown University, Harris conducted his Residency Pathology at Stanford University Medical School. Harris returned to his alma mater in 2010, this time as a Georgetown Medical School professor. He has since established the Georgetown Brain Bank and POND Bank, in addition to assuming the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for DC. Here he has been utilizing his proximity to the capital to initiate and lead many programs to advance the treatment and research for neuroinflammatory diseases including working with National organizations such as NIH.    Why His Work Matters Above all, Dr. Harris epitomizes every physician's vocational heart and every scientist's curious mind, combining both professions to help investigate the most difficult questions about brain disease. Learning about how Dr. Harris has maintained a profound impact in both clinical and translational research settings can inspire future students to pursue careers that emphasize the importance of making an impact that will be felt across the intricate fields of biomedical sciences. Lastly, Dr. Harris’ commitment to service in battling brain disease nationwide, demonstrates the significance of working in Medicine in the capital of the United States.  The MD/PhD Journey Before we can begin to understand Dr. Harris, we must first understand how he arrived at his current position. What is an MD/PhD? Why an MD/PhD? And what is a Neuropathologist? And funnily enough, Dr. Harris was once sitting in your exact seats asking the exact same questions.  Like many, Dr. Harris was a fan of science and medicine but was confused as to where these loves would lead him. In undergraduate, he pursued a Liberal Arts degree and balanced this with courses in the natural sciences. Before long, he found himself in a Summer program at the National Institutes of Health and decided he was going to pursue a career in the biomedical sciences. Once he completed a Master's in Biochemistry, he decided he finally was ready to apply to Medical School and devote his career in Medicine.  However, he did not want to leave science behind. Thus, he applied to pursue an MD/PhD. The MD/PhD is a combined program offered at many Medical Schools in order to train a unique group of Physician-Scientists, Doctors who can interface between the worlds of clinical and basic research, offering a wide expertise across a range of disciplines. Dr. Harris applied to Georgetown Medical School and pursued an MD/PhD in Neuroscience, citing the Brain as the “Final Frontier” in Medicine.    Faced with the decision of residency, Dr. Harris could choose Neurology, the study of diagnosing and managing disorders of the nervous system; Psychiatry, focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions; Neurosurgery, involving surgical interventions to treat diseases of the brain and spinal cord; or Neuropathology, the microscopic study of nervous system tissues to understand disease at the cellular level. Ultimately he found Neuropathology to be the most complimentary for understanding the core mechanisms of the brain’s functions as well as an avenue for critical support in all aspects of medicine.  “You kind of break down neuropathology into the clinical aspects, the teaching aspects and the research aspects,” Harris said. “I chose neuropathology because I enjoy doing all three of those things.” After making this leap into the unknown, Dr. Harris continued his career with stints in Residency at Stanford Medical Center and working at Dartmouth University. Only after this period, did Dr Harris finally return to DC, once again working in his Alma Mater of Georgetown University.  “I choose the last unknown frontier in medicine, the neurosciences when deciding where I wanted to spend the `

        excerpt: "Researchers in Washington D.C. are revolutionizing AI, MS treatments, and cancer therapies—pushing science forward with groundbreaking work.",
        content: `<p>Three researchers in Washington, D.C., are currently shaping our future through groundbreaking advancements in technology and medicine. From revolutionizing computing with brain-shaped technology and developing innovative treatments for multiple sclerosis to advancing therapies for aggressive breast cancer, these efforts are pushing the boundaries of science as we know it. Distinguished researchers like Dr. Gina Adam, Dr. Jeffrey Huang, and Dr. Barry Hudson are pioneering cutting-edge research that expands modern scientific understanding and offers tangible solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges — all from the nation’s capital. Dr. Gina Adam – Neuromorphic Computing and Nanotechnology As the world advances in its technological capabilities through powerful tools like AI, the search for more effective and advanced computing systems only grows. Dr. Gina Adam, an Assistant Professor at George Washington University, is working to develop neuromorphic computing and nanotechnology toward this aim. The word “neuromorphic” can be broken down into the Greek words neûron, meaning “string, nerve” and referring to the brain, and morphē, meaning “shape.” Simply put, neuromorphic computing employs computational methods to mimic the function of the brain by simulating the neural and synaptic processes it performs. Dr. Adam’s work focuses on developing “memristors,” which she describes as resistors with memory to recall how much charge they’ve passed. Meanwhile, traditional computers process information using a rigid structure of transistors and binary code of zeroes and ones. Although this approach has worked thus far, it is less effective with higher-complexity tasks like pattern recognition and real-time learning, and when it does attempt those complex tasks, it consumes vast amounts of energy. This limitation lies in how the transistors use sequential processing for information. Imagine that a large image is placed in front of someone. As soon as their eyes see it, the brain processes the information on several tracks — an ability called parallel processing — such that the experience stimulates pathways that evoke feelings from the amygdala, perception in the occipital cortex, and memory recall in the hippocampus. Transistors, however, must process each pixel one by one, requiring extensive time and energy. Close-up view on a nanotechnology electronic system 3D rendering by sdecoret So, How Do Memristors Work? The key to a memristor’s memory lies in resistive switching, which is typically achieved through ion migration or phase changes in the material. The most common way scientists use them to “remember information” is through ion migration, which occurs when an applied voltage creates or fills oxygen vacancies (missing atoms) of metal oxides such as titanium dioxide or hafnium oxide inside the memristor, creating new conductive pathways or removing old ones, effectively “encoding” a retained memory state even after the current information is terminated. Unlike binary logic, memristors can process a range of values, enabling them to perform parallelized tasks like image and speech recognition. How Dr. Adam’s Work is Revolutionizing Computing One of Dr. Adam’s most notable developments is 3D memristor crossbar arrays — a design that stacks memristors into layers, improving their efficiency. Currently, her lab focuses on integrating a novel category of memristors called ReRAM switches. These two-terminal electronic devices incorporate resistive switching, which involves a dielectric material that can rapidly adjust its resistance into arrays and dense matrices when sufficient voltage is applied. The ability to stack and integrate memristors together offers immense potential for the development of smaller, smarter, and more efficient devices with higher processing capacities per unit space. This revolutionary design additionally offers potential to develop an energy-efficient data center capable of processing massive data inputs using only a fraction of its current power consumption. Finally, the “memory” stored in these devices may also provide a unique ability to give them “digital fingerprints,” making them less vulnerable to malicious hackers and cybersecurity threats. Dr. Adam’s innovative research in neuromorphic computing and nanotechnology is forging a new path in the development of high-functioning and high-processing machines. Her work is paving the way for a new generation of AI-powered technologies with the capacity to shape industries and improve countless lives. Dr. Jeffrey Huang – Advancements in Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease affecting  roughly 2.8 million people worldwide, according to the National MS Society in 2019. Over time, the disease causes progressive nerve damage, physical disability, and cognitive decline. Despite decades of research, scientists have struggled to develop effective treatments capable of repairing years`

        content: `<p>“You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future” - Steve Jobs. Every scientist begins their journey with a general sense of direction, attempting to become an expert in one field.  However, it is not always obvious what path your interests will lead you down. In many cases, this induces anxiety for those pursuing a career in STEM, as we are told to “figure out what you want to do” for the rest of your life. Sitting down with Professor Michael Keidar, we will trace the steps of his illustrious career backwards, learning about how he tackled these exact questions that landed him to work in applying his knowledge across diverse fields such as brain tumor therapy, satellite design, and electromagnetic-induced drug delivery. Plasma and Purpose: The Multifaceted Journey of Dr. Michael Keidar Who:  Professor Michael Keidar is The James A. Clark Professor of Mechanical Engineering at George Washington University. His main research interests focus on designing optimized propulsion technology for spacecrafts such as satellites, and developing nanoscale plasma technology. Despite this, some of his most well-known work was his application of cold plasmas in cancer therapy, demonstrating his ability to apply his work across fields. Professor Keidar completed his PhD at Tel Aviv University and Postdoc appointments at UC Berkeley and Cornell University. He recently received a DARPA grant to develop low flying satellites powered by atmospheric pressure differences.  Why:  Many believe a scientific career is limited to either purely basic research or theoretical expertise. However, Dr. Keidar demonstrates that one can be a trailblazer in both fundamental research and make an impact on the lives of others. Furthermore, his career showcases the importance of obtaining valuable skills that can be applied across fields, unlocking the potential to maintain interdisciplinary interests. Many of us can benefit from hearing the story of such an impactful scientist, who continues to trailblaze almost 30 years after he began.  Understanding the Fourth State of Matter: Plasma’s Role in the Universe Micropropulsion of Satellites. Cancer Therapy. Electromagnetic Induced Cellular Responses.  To the naked eye, these are wildly different fields, each separated by vast oceans of knowledge. However, Michael Keidar sees them all connected through the unifying state of the universe: plasma.  The three states of matter — solid, liquid, and gas — are commonly taught in Middle School science. However, the state that makes up over 99% of the universe, plasma, is almost always forgotten. Image Credit: “Blue glowing multidimensional plasma force field in space” by sakkmesterke. Licensed under an Education License.. Plasma is likely omitted from the standard middle school curriculum because it requires a deeper understanding of electromagnetic forces and ionization, both of which are taught in High School. Moving forward in our understanding of the world, we begin to learn about plasma, the state of matter that makes up over 99% of the universe. Everything from lightning to stars to fluorescent light bulbs is made of plasma.  To create plasma, a gas is superheated, leading many of the electrons to be stripped away. This induces an electrical imbalance on the gas particles that generate what we call “plasma.” Thus, plasma consists of highly energized particles, producing electrically conductive material that interacts strongly with the electromagnetic field.  And here lies the secret to the story of plasmas. The interaction of the highly charged species of particles in plasmas within the electromagnetic field induces an electromagnetic interaction. The fundamental ideas of plasma are the dots that Keidar connects throughout his career.  Lightning Strikes: How Plasma Found Michael Keidar Growing up in the USSR during the Cold War, Keidar was brought up in the thick of the Space Age. Naturally, Keidar began to ask questions about the fundamentals of spacecraft propulsion from a young age. From these interests, he completed his undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering with a focus on electrical space propulsion from the Kharkov Aviation Institute. His education focused primarily on practical applications, centering on designing more propulsion systems for efficient satellites to save energy and conserve space.  “At that time, [it] was considered quite advanced,” Keidar said. “The idea was to use electricity instead of heating fuel and oxidizer, you can reach much higher velocities and use less… but there are downsides as electricity is limited on satellites.”  Here, at the end of his undergraduate degree, he saw the first possibilities of plasma, beginning to study more fundamental questions dealing with the nature of plasmas as opposed to their application. After completing his PhD in Plasma Engineering at Tel Aviv University, Keidar c`

        content: `<p>While many scientific pursuits involve structured pre-professional programs and a clear long-term vision of your desired end goal, there are many opportunities and pathways to discover your interests and pursue a career that meets them. In a conversion about his journey from his graduate studies in Chemistry at Georgetown University, to his current work as a physical scientist in the Forensics Division of the United States Secret Service, Dr. Lucas Kane describes his journey exploring his interests and navigating the stressful world of career-searching to land his current position. Introduction: From Fluorine to Forensics Who: Dr. Lucas Kane is a recent graduate from Georgetown University, whose thesis work investigates carbon-fluorine bond functionalization— essentially exploring methods to break the notably strong and stable bond between carbon and fluorine, and transform it into a carbon-carbon bond— an ability with extensive and practical applications in fields like synthetic, environmental, and pharmaceutical chemistry. Kane completed his PhD at Georgetown this past summer (2024) and began his new work as a Forensic Chemist in the United States Secret Service, developing new and innovative forensic analysis methodologies. Why Unlike some of the humanities fields, science careers usually require very targeted and technical expertise, urging many students in STEM to commit to a specific field early on in their studies, before they’ve even been given a chance to explore their interests. Conversing with students who’ve carved out their own path can provide invaluable insights into the process of effectively navigating these questions throughout your studies. Early Beginnings Dr. Lucas Kane’s fascination with Chemistry began in high school, in a way most of us are familiar with: a really excellent teacher. Though initially more math and physics-oriented, Kane was inspired by Dr. Lori Kurth, his junior and senior-year Chemistry teacher: “Without Dr. Kurth, I’m not doing this.”  Fascinated by the problem-solving nature of chemistry, and the opportunity to pursue an education that delves into the molecular composition of life, Kane decided to major in Chemistry. “I didn’t know what my career would look like, but I knew that I liked chemistry, so that’s what I studied.” Pursuing a Graduate Degree: The good, the bad, the uncertainties. Midway through his undergraduate studies, as he explored his next steps, Kane’s conversation with his advisor opened him up to the idea of continuing his Chemistry education in graduate school. “We talked about graduate school, and I loved the research aspect. I love thinking creatively about how we can examine the world through the lens of chemistry, and that’s really what research is to me. I also learned that if I wanted to be trusted as an independent researcher, and if I wanted to be able to explore the world through my own ideas, I would need a PhD to be able to do that.” Finding a graduate studies program is no simple process. After applying to graduate programs in several schools, students undergo recruitment visits, in which they meet faculty who pitch their research and work. After enrolling in an institution and undergoing a semester of studies, they must select a research advisor to provide guidance as they complete their thesis research work. “It’s a little risky to go to graduate school if there’s only one group that you could really see yourself being successful in, because sometimes there’s competition to get into those groups… and if there’s five incoming students and they all want to go to that one group, you might find yourself in a situation where you feel like you don’t have a home… Georgetown was attractive for me because there were multiple places where I could see myself being successful.” Upon arriving at Georgetown, Kane joined Dr. Tim Warren’s lab, whose work investigated nitrogen reduction and ammonia oxidation chemistry. Interested in research on clean energy, Kane wanted to study nitrogen reduction for its potential applications in converting atmospheric nitrogen to clean fuel. But after two and a half years of work, Kane was required to pivot when his mentor left Georgetown. Faced with the options to either move and join Warren in Michigan, or begin anew at Georgetown, he chose the latter. Redirection: Roadblocks and finding new routes Undiscouraged by the setback, Kane began a new search for a mentor, and eventually transitioned into Dr. Christian Wolf’s lab– in the organic chemistry department. Though initially focused on inorganic synthesis, Kane credits what he calls a ‘seamless transition’ into organic chemistry, to the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry, and Wolf’s mentorship. “In Tim's lab I was doing inorganic synthesis primarily, and then I joined an organic synthesis group, but there's so much overlap there that I was really able to hit the ground running. And Christian really is the hallmark of a good mentor; somebody who is willing `

        excerpt: "From music to materials science, Professor Christopher Cahill’s journey shows how unexpected turns spark curiosity, innovation, and impact.",
        content: `<p>Professor Christopher Cahill, a distinguished multidisciplinary professor at George Washington University, is a leading expert in inorganic and materials chemistry, specializing in actinides and their role in nuclear processes. Leveraging his unique position in Washington D.C., Professor Cahill has advanced the field's understanding of these f-block elements while shaping discourse on their potential involvement in nuclear policy.  An Unconventional Start in STEM: From Music to Materials Science Professor Cahill’s journey into science began as a digression from his intended trajectory into music. Soon after enrolling at SUNY Fredonia, his band teacher’s alma mater, his aspiration to become a band teacher faltered when he realized he had been fueled by undue praise and lacked the skill to excel at the collegiate level of music.  \"Being a high school star didn't translate to college, and I lacked the talent needed. It was humbling.\" But just as one door closed, another opened. On the day of course registration, Cahill happened to be in line next to chemistry professor James Bowser, who recommended that Cahill take a few core science classes. Despite the radical pivot, with just one introductory course in chemistry and another in geology, he was hooked - acquiring a BS in Chemistry and Geochemistry and igniting a lifelong passion. Inspired by the mentorship of chemist John B. Parise during an undergraduate research internship at Stony Brook University, Cahill would apply to Parise’ lab again to pursue a PhD in Chemistry. Surrounded by like-minded, intellectually engaging individuals at Stony Brook and with access to Brookhaven National Lab, a Department of Energy facility, Cahill cultivated his zeal for crystallography and materials chemistry. Driven by his love for chemistry and interest in crystals and minerals, Cahill pursued a postdoc in the Environmental Mineralogy Group at Notre Dame University, where he worked on characterizing natural uranium minerals to consider their potential applications in nuclear waste storage or geologic repositories. Following his postdoc, Cahill joined GWU as a professor, where he taught coursework in chemistry and international affairs and was the principal investigator of a laboratory focused on solid-state and materials chemistry. The Charm of Crystals and Hybrid Materials With a curious fascination in Geology and Chemistry, Professor Cahill developed an interest in crystallography, the perfect unifier of these two scientific branches. Applying the principles of crystallography and its derived tools, it became possible to research and characterize hybrid materials.  Hybrid materials are synergistic combinations of inorganic and organic constituents on a molecular scale. This relatively novel area of research is rapidly expanding and presents a compelling challenge to synthesize materials with enhanced functionality and performance for innovative applications. While their inorganic components provide a stable and rigid framework, the organic components enable flexibility to customize novel or enhanced materials with unique properties. Expanding the library of synthetic hybrid materials requires optimizing the approach of assembling chemical constituents to maximize the synergy of organic-inorganic frameworks. Cahill’s lab specializes in uranyl-containing hybrid materials; his group probes properties such as second-sphere effects, energy transfer, or luminescence to better understand their behaviors and potential applications.  Working with his graduate and undergraduate students, Cahill views his lab’s collaborative effort as a contribution to what he calls the ‘intellectual forum’ of actinides, in which members hone skills in crystallography and nuclear chemistry.    Bridging Science and Policy As a professor in both Chemistry and International Affairs, Cahill has contributed his efforts to bolstering the intersection between these disciplines to address global nuclear issues while nourishing his own curiosities. In the Elliott School of International Affairs, his course “Science of Nuclear Materials” empowers non-scientific students interested in the nuclear arena with the basics of nuclear chemistry, expanding their capacity to put forth influential, informed policy.  Throughout his time serving as a Science Fellow at the American Institute of Physics in the US State Department’s Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism within the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, Cahill developed his understanding of how policy can help shape scientific initiatives. This experience informed his teaching and inspired his commitment to train a new generation of “hybrid thinkers” capable of navigating the intersection of science and policy. Cahill aims to remain involved and active in shaping the future policymakers at GW and using his diverse background to encourage scientifically minded students to consider roles in policy-making.
