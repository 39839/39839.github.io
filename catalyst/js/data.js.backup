        content: `<p>Vibrant fluorescent microscopy image showing the active movement of microglia in response to brain injury by Justlight. Licensed under the Education License</p>
<p>I hereby plea for a moment of recognition for the unsung hero of the nervous system– the glial cell concealed under the shadow of the more-popular astrocyte– the humble microglia.</p>
<p>To many, the microglia evokes thoughts of a boring macrophage, limited by the borders of the CNS. I would like to dispel these thoughts, first of all, by clarifying that the microglia is a species of its own; unlike the macrophage, our friendly microglia is yolk-sac derived. Secondly– sure the astrocyte provides metabolic support and assists the endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier, but who, I implore, defends our sacred neurons when intruders make their way through? Who relentlessly phagocytoses viruses and bacteria? Who unleashes reactive oxygen species, cytokines and chemokines to destroy enemies of the body and recruit the immune response? Who releases matrix metalloproteinases to clear the way for additional glia to come to aid? Who, I beg? Our valiant warrior not only responds to cellular stress and events of neuronal injury; microglia, as well, facilitate the processes that make you and me– you and me.</p>
<p>Throughout development, as neurons make redundant, careless connections, our faithful microglia survey the neuronal environment and carefully contemplate, based on synaptic activity, which synapses to accept, and which to prune. We have the microglia to thank for the efficiency of neuronal transmission, and for the healthy development of our brains. And while you and I have done our fair share of avoiding chores (when was the last time you vacuumed your room?) microglia are constantly cleaning the cellular environment, caringly and lovingly removing debris to ensure a squeaky and pristine landscape, hospitable to its fellow neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, schwann cells, ependymal cells, and endothelial cells.</p>
<p>Microglia may be the smallest glial cell in size, but they shan’t be underestimated. So allow me, please, to raise a toast for our unacknowledged friend; a moment of appreciation for the microglia.</p>`

        content: `<p>"Being a high school star didn't translate to college, and I lacked the talent needed. It was humbling."</p>
<p>But just as one door closed, another opened. On the day of course registration, Cahill happened to be in line next to chemistry professor James Bowser, who recommended that Cahill take a few core science classes. Despite the radical pivot, with just one introductory course in chemistry and another in geology, he was hooked - acquiring a BS in Chemistry and Geochemistry and igniting a lifelong passion.</p>
<p>Inspired by the mentorship of chemist John B. Parise during an undergraduate research internship at Stony Brook University, Cahill would apply to Parise’ lab again to pursue a PhD in Chemistry. Surrounded by like-minded, intellectually engaging individuals at Stony Brook and with access to Brookhaven National Lab, a Department of Energy facility, Cahill cultivated his zeal for crystallography and materials chemistry. Driven by his love for chemistry and interest in crystals and minerals, Cahill pursued a postdoc in the Environmental Mineralogy Group at Notre Dame University, where he worked on characterizing natural uranium minerals to consider their potential applications in nuclear waste storage or geologic repositories.</p>
<p>Following his postdoc, Cahill joined GWU as a professor, where he taught coursework in chemistry and international affairs and was the principal investigator of a laboratory focused on solid-state and materials chemistry.</p>
<p>The Charm of Crystals and Hybrid Materials</p>
<p>With a curious fascination in Geology and Chemistry, Professor Cahill developed an interest in crystallography, the perfect unifier of these two scientific branches. Applying the principles of crystallography and its derived tools, it became possible to research and characterize hybrid materials.</p>
<p>Hybrid materials are synergistic combinations of inorganic and organic constituents on a molecular scale. This relatively novel area of research is rapidly expanding and presents a compelling challenge to synthesize materials with enhanced functionality and performance for innovative applications. While their inorganic components provide a stable and rigid framework, the organic components enable flexibility to customize novel or enhanced materials with unique properties. Expanding the library of synthetic hybrid materials requires optimizing the approach of assembling chemical constituents to maximize the synergy of organic-inorganic frameworks.</p>
<p>Cahill’s lab specializes in uranyl-containing hybrid materials; his group probes properties such as second-sphere effects, energy transfer, or luminescence to better understand their behaviors and potential applications.</p>
<p>Working with his graduate and undergraduate students, Cahill views his lab’s collaborative effort as a contribution to what he calls the ‘intellectual forum’ of actinides, in which members hone skills in crystallography and nuclear chemistry.</p>
<p>Bridging Science and Policy</p>
<p>As a professor in both Chemistry and International Affairs, Cahill has contributed his efforts to bolstering the intersection between these disciplines to address global nuclear issues while nourishing his own curiosities. In the Elliott School of International Affairs, his course “Science of Nuclear Materials” empowers non-scientific students interested in the nuclear arena with the basics of nuclear chemistry, expanding their capacity to put forth influential, informed policy.</p>
<p>Throughout his time serving as a Science Fellow at the American Institute of Physics in the US State Department’s Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism within the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, Cahill developed his understanding of how policy can help shape scientific initiatives. This experience informed his teaching and inspired his commitment to train a new generation of “hybrid thinkers” capable of navigating the intersection of science and policy.</p>
<p>Cahill aims to remain involved and active in shaping the future policymakers at GW and using his diverse background to encourage scientifically minded students to consider roles in policy-making. His collaborative efforts with national labs, governmental organizations, and other universities ensure that scientific input remains a fundamental part of international policy discussions.</p>
<h2>Mentoring Future Innovators</h2>
<p>Reflecting on his own transformative experiences, Professor Cahill is a passionate advocate for mentorship and providing meaningful guidance to students. He is committed to cultivating a supportive learning environment in the classroom and the lab and looks to balance academic rigor with well-being.</p>
<p>Cahill’s commitment to mentorship has been recognized through several prestigious awards, including the Oscar and Shoshana Trachtenberg Prize for Teaching Excellence in 2013 and the GW Office of the Vice President for Research’s Research Mentorship Award in 2021.</p>
<p>In his laboratory, Professor Cahill emphasizes hands-on research experiences, guiding both undergraduate and graduate students through complex projects in inorganic and materials chemistry. He encourages critical thinking and innovation, preparing his mentees for successful careers in science and future endeavors.</p>

<p>Main Takeaways from Cahill’s Advice:</p>
<p>Embrace the Unexpected</p>
<p>Professor Cahill’s journey into chemistry and nuclear materials began with a seemingly failed attempt to pursue a music career. But the unexpected shift into science—sparked by a low-chance encounter with a chemistry professor—opened the door to a rewarding career that completely changed his life and that of countless students.</p>
<p>“When one door closes, another always opens, but we usually look so long, so intently and so sorrowfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one that has opened." — Jean Paul Richter</p>
<p>Cahill’s story highlights the importance of staying open to unexpected opportunities and knowing how to pivot when necessary. Allow yourself to explore unfamiliar academic territories. Don’t be discouraged when an initial plan doesn’t pan out. Instead, trust that a different opportunity will come along, often in ways you never imagined.</p>
<p>Build a Broad Foundation</p>
<p>Don’t limit yourself to a single focus or interest. Proactively seek skills and knowledge outside your immediate field—whether understanding the policy implications of your science, learning to code and analyze data, or seeking relationships and discourse with people who view the world differently.  The broader range of information you hold makes you better prepared to tackle new problems and look at concepts with a “hybrid” perspective.</p>

        excerpt: "Dr. Jeffrey Huang's lab holds a patent for a potential new MS drug targeting amino acid transporters."
        content: `<p>For those who are less familiar with the brain, neurons— the primary cell of the central nervous system— form a complex communication system that enables us to think, experience, perform and exist as conscious beings. Unlike most cells of the body, which communicate by chemical signals, neurons mediate fast signal transmission through electrical currents produced by ion flow. This can sometimes involve direct ion transmission between neurons (at gap junctions), but neurons most often communicate by releasing molecules, known as neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters can act as agonists for ion channels– allowing the movement of ions in/out of the cell to create an electrical current– or they may bind to G-protein coupled receptors, which either cause cellular changes through second messengers, or open ion channels. You may have heard of some of these neurotransmitters (ex. glutamate, GABA, serotonin), but today’s discussion centers on dopamine.</p>

<p>Dopamine in the Brain</p>
<p>Dopamine serves several functions in the brain (such as movement and emotion), but some of its key functions include learning, attention, and reward. You can think of dopamine as an ‘I want more,’ ‘feel-good’ signal. Unlike, for example, a content and peaceful, looking-out-into-the-sunset happiness, in which you feel at peace, dopamine is a good feeling that drives you to keep going. Think chocolate: one bite is great, but you always want another. Behaviors that involve a drive associated with reward, such as pleasurable foods and sex, involve dopamine; so does, for example, drug addiction– dopamine is a powerful chemical. The relevance of dopamine to your studying has exactly to do with this: studying is difficult to do, but on the molecular level, it is not a foreign process to your brain. Everything you know now, you once did not. The difficulty with studying and learning often lies with initiation and with the personal motivation to just do it. The beautiful thing, though, is that you reap the benefits of this labor: at the end, there comes a good grade, or, more importantly, an intrinsic feeling of success and accomplishment. Of reward. The culprit? Dopamine. We talk frequently of discipline and work ethic, but the mind, like the rest of us, functions by means of physical, tangible processes. Though ‘discipline’ is a nice concept, it should be noted that there are real, physical mechanisms that allow us to ‘do,’ and to want to do, and the release of dopamine is crucial to these mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Dopamine: Limitations & Implications</h2>
<p>So let’s get nittier. Chemicals don’t appear out of thin air; dopamine is produced from precursors in the cell, and stored in vesicles at the bottom of the neuron, ready to be released. When signaling initiates an ion current, the contents of the vesicles are released from the neuron, releasing dopamine to other neurons. It is important to understand that this process involves first synthesis, and then release, because the availability of dopamine, to drive us to perform activities, is dependent on these processes. There is no infinite supply, and availability is not a continuous and stable ‘given’. If you deplete your dopamine stock through mindless stimulation, you will decrease your drive to perform subsequent behaviors. When you perform a rewarding behavior, such as scrolling on social media mindlessly, it is truly difficult to stop. If I lie down on a sofa and then want to get up, I have no problem doing so. But for some reason, when it's 11:57pm and I know I need to get to sleep already, but have to get up to brush my teeth first, it’s nearly impossible. The bursts of dopamine prompted by my explore page– perfectly curated to pique my interests– have deprived me of the drive to do other things. This is one of the reasons why everyone and their mother tell you not to get on your phone first thing in the morning; it doesn’t just ‘set the tone,’ it robs you of drive.</p>
<p>Contextualizing Dopamine in Your Life</p>
<p>While we all like to feel good, it could be helpful to think of dopamine like cash, and your brain as the wallet. In theory, you could spend your money on anything you’d like; you could enter a mall and buy everything until you’re out. But to get more money, you need to do work– and some things provide more instant gratification, but take away from your ability to make better, more rewarding purchases in the future. Next time you have an urge to scroll on your phone, think of it like m&ms; they’re great and all, but would you waste your money and pay for them if it comes out of your retirement fund, or even just your savings for a trip? To continue with the analogy of money, cash is earned through work: dopamine is too. As you perform the difficult task of learning, memorizing, and thinking, your brain synthesizes more dopamine. More effort materializes in stronger feelings of reward.</p>
<p>Additionally important is to not only anticipate some struggle, but also to aim for it– or at least accept it. When we constantly increase our baseline dopamine levels, the experience of reward will begin to diminish, and we need more and more stimulation to experience these feelings. This is part of the underlying physical components of drug addiction. Though this may sound discouraging to consider, it should serve as a welcome reminder that you can actually look forward to the difficult feelings of effort with the knowledge that they will actually result in more reward. But also, this should caution you away from piling on quick and easy sources of dopamine (ex. always listening to music on runs, rewarding yourself for schoolwork/performance with unhealthy foods, drinking energy drinks every time you need more focus). Every now and then, we all need to do what we need to do, but be cognizant and mindful that you aren’t relying on them constantly; over time, if everything is always easy and enjoyable, we don’t just notice that other things aren’t as enjoyable, but they actually become less enjoyable.</p>
<h2>What is the Main Takeaway?</h2>
<p>There is much more to say about dopamine, and I will leave some great and approachable resources below. To summarize, though, there is no molecule that makes anything easy, and as students with the job to learn, our task will never not be effortful. However, our drive, which pushes us to perform the work we are required to do, has a chemical basis: dopamine. Like everything in life, dopamine is a finite resource, limited by the presence of its precursors and the time of its synthesis. Through quick, mindless, and high dopamine release, you reduce your neurons’ supply, and consequently your drive to perform ambitious tasks, such as studying. Additionally, increasing your baseline levels of dopamine through continuous use of quick sources, will increase your threshold levels necessary to facilitate drive. To leverage this information to enhance your ability to perform rigorous tasks like studying, avoid dopamine-depleting activities like social media and intensely satisfying foods/treats, especially before work, and prevent increased baseline levels through consistent layering or reliance on dopamine sources. I know this information isn’t ‘fun,’ and ‘easy,’ but hopefully a look into the biological mechanisms involved in effort can help you better consider decisions, or at least become more mindful of their stakes and implications.</p>`

        excerpt: "Dr. Sarah Shomstein reveals how our mind silently sorts the sensory chaos around us."
        content: `<p>The magnetic field (B) arises directly from moving electric charges. This can be a current flowing through a wire or the coordinated motion of electrons within the atoms of a permanent magnet. This is a crucial distinction. While you can have an isolated positive or negative electric charge, you can never have an isolated north or south magnetic pole. If you cut a magnet in half, you simply get two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south. This is a direct reflection of the fact that magnetism is the product of charges in motion.</p>
<p>For centuries, this connection remained a curiosity. A current could deflect a compass needle, and a moving magnet could create a current. The relationship was there, but it took a unifying vision to see the full picture.</p>
<p>Maxwell's Unification</p>
<p>The scattered puzzle pieces of electricity and magnetism were finally assembled in the mid-19th century by physicist James Clerk Maxwell. Through a powerful set of equations, he elegantly described the relationship that we now take for granted.</p>
<p>He built upon the known principle of induction: a changing magnetic field creates an electric field. This is how we generate most of our electricity, by spinning magnets inside coils of wire in power plants.</p>
<p>But Maxwell's crucial insight was discovering the symmetry: a changing electric field also creates a magnetic field. This might seem like a subtle point, but it was the key that unlocked everything. It meant the two fields were locked in a reciprocal relationship, each capable of creating the other.</p>
<h2>Electromagnetic Waves: The Result of Unity</h2>
<p>ree</p>
<p>This perfect symmetry led Maxwell to a remarkable prediction. If a changing electric field creates a magnetic one, which in turn creates a new electric field, couldn't this interaction travel through space as a self-sustaining wave?</p>
<p>He calculated the speed of such a wave based on his equations and found it to be a very familiar number: the speed of light (c). The implication was staggering: light itself is an electromagnetic wave. The entire spectrum, from radio waves and Wi-Fi to visible light and X-rays, is composed of these electric and magnetic fields, continuously regenerating each other as they travel through space.</p>
<h2>Concluding Thoughts: A Single, Fundamental Force</h2>
<p>The relationship between electricity and magnetism is more intimate than a simple partnership. They are two aspects of a single, unified force. A stationary charge gives us a pure electric field, but putting that charge in motion reveals the magnetic facet of that same fundamental interaction. It's a beautiful example of how a change in perspective, in this case, motion, can reveal a deeper truth about the nature of our universe. From the motors that power our homes to the light and data reaching our screens, this unified force is the invisible engine of our world.</p>`

        excerpt: "Environmental racism and climate hazards disproportionately harm marginalized communities in D.C."
        content: `<p>While many scientific careers involve structured pre-professional programs and a clear long-term vision of your desired end goal, there are many opportunities to discover your interests along the way. In a conversion about his journey from his graduate studies in Chemistry at Georgetown University, to his current work as a physical scientist in the Forensic Services Division of the United States Secret Service, Dr. Lucas Kane describes his journey exploring his interests and navigating the stressful world of career-searching to land his current position.</p>
<p>Who: Dr. Lucas Kane is a recent graduate from Georgetown University, whose thesis work investigates carbon-fluorine bond functionalization— essentially exploring methods to break the notably strong and stable bond between carbon and fluorine, and transform it into a carbon-carbon bond— an ability with extensive and practical applications in fields like synthetic, environmental, and pharmaceutical chemistry. Kane completed his PhD at Georgetown this past summer (2024) and began his new work as a Forensic Chemist in the United States Secret Service, developing new and innovative forensic analysis methodologies.</p>
<p>Why: Unlike some of the humanities fields, science careers usually require very targeted and technical expertise, urging many students in STEM to commit to a specific field early on in their studies, before they’ve even been given a chance to explore their interests. Conversing with students who’ve carved out their own path can provide invaluable insights into the process of effectively navigating these questions throughout your studies.</p>
<h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
<p>Dr. Lucas Kane’s fascination with Chemistry began in high school, in a way most of us are familiar with: a really excellent teacher. Though initially more math and physics-oriented, Kane was inspired by Dr. Lori Kurth, his junior and senior-year Chemistry teacher. Fascinated by the problem-solving nature of chemistry, and the opportunity to pursue an education that delves into the molecular composition of life, Kane decided to major in Chemistry.</p>
<p>Pursuing a Graduate Degree: The good, the bad, the uncertainties.</p>
<p>Midway through his undergraduate studies, as he explored his next steps, Kane’s conversation with his advisor opened him up to the idea of continuing his Chemistry education in graduate school.</p>
<p>“We talked about graduate school, and I loved the research aspect. I love thinking creatively about how we can examine the world through the lens of chemistry, and that’s really what research is to me. I also learned that if I wanted to be trusted as an independent researcher, and if I wanted to be able to explore the world through my own ideas, I would need a PhD to be able to do that.” Finding a graduate studies program is no simple process. After applying to graduate programs in several schools, students undergo recruitment visits, in which they meet faculty who pitch their research and work. After enrolling in an institution and undergoing a semester of studies, they must select a research advisor to provide guidance as they complete their thesis research work.</p>
<p>“It’s a little risky to go to graduate school if there’s only one group that you could really see yourself being successful in, because sometimes there’s competition to get into those groups… and if there’s five incoming students and they all want to go to that one group, you might find yourself in a situation where you feel like you don’t have a home… Georgetown was attractive for me because there were multiple places where I could see myself being successful.” Upon arriving at Georgetown, Kane joined Dr. Tim Warren’s lab, whose work investigated nitrogen reduction and ammonia oxidation chemistry. Interested in research on clean energy, Kane wanted to study nitrogen reduction for its potential applications in converting atmospheric nitrogen to clean fuel. But after two and a half years of work, Kane was required to pivot when his mentor left Georgetown. Faced with the options to either move and join Warren in Michigan, or begin anew at Georgetown, he chose the latter.</p>
<h2>Redirection: Roadblocks and finding new routes</h2>
<p>Undiscouraged by the setback, Kane began a new search for a mentor, and eventually transitioned into Dr. Christian Wolf’s lab– in the organic chemistry department. Though initially focused on inorganic synthesis, Kane credits what he calls a ‘seamless transition’ into organic chemistry, to the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry, and Wolf’s mentorship.</p>
<p>“In Tim's lab I was doing inorganic synthesis primarily, and then I joined an organic synthesis group, but there's so much overlap there that I was really able to hit the ground running. And Christian really is the hallmark of a good mentor; somebody who is willing to go outside their comfort zone and place a great deal of trust in their colleagues— and that's what he did for me.” In the fourth year of his graduate program, Dr. Kane’s thesis began to materialize. Transitioning towards organic synthesis strategies, he focused on carbon-fluorine bond functionalization; essentially replacing carbon-fluorine bonds with carbon-carbon bonds. Though highly available in the environment– often as pollutants– fluorinated organics are a problematic nuisance due to the high electronegativity difference between carbon and fluorine, which renders the C-F bond highly stable.</p>
<p>Under Wolf’s guidance and support, Kane developed a strategy to cleave C-F bonds using metals like Zinc, and convert them to C-C bonds– the building blocks of organic chemistry.</p>
<h2>Future Directions— Beyond the Scientific Literature: Determining His Next Steps</h2>
<h2>Beginning</h2>
<p>With his thesis in the works, Kane– like every other student– was left to grapple with and begin planning his future. One of the challenging aspects of the process, he notes, was the uncertainty of timing in graduate school.</p>
<p>“In grad school, there’s no set finish line. You don’t necessarily know when the end is going to arrive– because in research you can’t just say, ‘I’m going to finish this project in six months. You have no idea when it’s going to be over.’” Reflecting on his own experiences, he notes his initial anxiety to begin the job search, which caused him to procrastinate– an experience we’ve all encountered in one way or another. But, in retrospect, Dr. Kane advises students to begin the process earlier– around nine to 12 months before graduating– as a general recommendation. He also emphasizes the importance of clear communication throughout the process. Kane stressed the support and flexibility of his mentor, Dr. Wolf, throughout the uncertain timeline of the job search, which he explained required his initial transparency and clear communication.</p>
<h2>Deciding</h2>
<p>With many avenues to choose from—ranging from academic research to pharmaceuticals, environmental work, and even intellectual property– Kane was drawn to government work, and forensics, specifically.</p>
<p>“In academia, a lot of the research that gets done is done out of curiosity, really… and I think there’s a lot of value in our academic minds, exploring our curiosity… but I wanted to see a more direct impact with the work I was doing.” That’s not to say the road to forensic chemistry was clearly defined. In graduate school, Kane says, “your career is very much what you make it.” Reflecting on various aspects of pre-professional planning as a graduate student, he highlights two key components:</p>
<h2>Networking: Not Only Useful for the Business School Students…</h2>
<p>“The people around you in your laboratory and in your program– those are the people that you have to pull into your network, especially people who are a little bit ahead of the game compared with you. Because in a couple of years, those are the people that you can turn to and say, ‘Hey, I need some advice.’” Describing his introduction to government work, for example, Kane mentioned the support of a student who graduated just as he joined Dr. Wolf’s group, and began work in the FDA. These relationships, he explained, helped him find opportunities and guidance.</p>
<h2>Skills: The Value of Broadening Your Expertise</h2>
<p>“In academia, I think many would argue that your publications are the most important thing on your resume… they’re your products, really. But if you’re trying to go into industry or government work, like I did, those publications are nice, but your resume is your skillset.” Kane emphasizes the importance of seeking opportunities to sharpen your skills in diverse techniques and methodologies. He notes the importance of taking initiative to find these opportunities, rather than expecting opportunities to fall into your lap.</p>
<p>Citing an example, he describes:</p>
<p>“At Georgetown, for example, we have a lot of facilities for X-Ray Crystallography… and we have a full-time X-Ray Crystallographer on staff whose job is to help people do X-Ray Crystallography…. And people don’t take advantage of that, in my opinion. So the opportunities are there and the people are there, but I encourage people to take advantage of that and develop your skill set, because at the end of the day, your skill set is what will set you apart.” Many of these opportunities to hone his skills, he explained, emerged as he developed his research project. In answering his research questions, he needed to refine his expertise with certain analysis strategies. Some, like NMR and GCMS, naturally presented themselves– but others, like X-Ray Crystallography– required a willingness to explore new techniques that could elevate his research.</p>
<p>“So when you have challenging research questions… I encourage people to try to understand what needs to be done to answer that question, and if it requires a new technique that you haven’t done, that’s not a bummer, right? That’s an opportunity to expand your knowledge and skillset.”</p>
<h2>Present Day Work: The old and the new</h2>
<p>In his current position as a physical scientist in the Forensic Division of the United States Secret Service, Dr. Kane develops novel analytical techniques for investigating forensic specimens. His colleagues contribute unique backgrounds and perspectives, ranging from chemists to biologists, engineers, physicists– as well as experts in law enforcement, the military, and more. “We all have different perspectives, thoughts and experiences, and that makes us strong as a team.”</p>
<p>This collaboration, which he notes as one of his favorite aspects of the job, is reminiscent of that which he experienced as a graduate student, in partnerships with other disciplines, such as immunology.</p>
<p>In terms of adjustments and new ‘analytical hoops,’ as he calls them, Kane refers to the highly-regulated nature of federal work.</p>
<p>“We have a to be a lot more careful and thoughtful in the ways we conduct our analysis, maintain our instrumentation, develop our protocols… everything has to be very, very tight… and it’s for good reason, because when you’re working on a case, there’s a lot at stake for a human being, typically.”</p>
<h2>Final Remarks: A message to students</h2>
<p>Asked to reflect on some final suggestions to students, Dr. Kane said, “Two things come to mind.”</p>
<p>Remove the Box “First, I would strongly recommend that you don’t put yourself in a box… It’s 100% okay to have something that you are super interested in, and that’s your thing. I think that’s good. But with that being said, I think it’s a mistake to then reject other areas, other ideas, and become so narrow, so early on. Because science is all connected, and the more you’re able to bring other disciplines into your focus, the stronger you become as a scientist.”</p>
<h2>The Obstacle Mindset</h2>
<p>“The other thing is, I feel like some of these decisions feel very monumental in the moment… for example for me, entering graduate school, which group I would end up joining felt like a monumental decision… but that ‘monumental decision’ completely crumbled halfway throughout my career… and I was sitting there thinking, ‘Am I going to have to start completely over right now? Should I just completely quit graduate school?’… and looking back on it now, I feel almost silly I had that mindset. Because if you continue to pursue your passions, if you’re motivated by a genuine interest, then there’s no reason that that type of setback has to stop you. So that's one thing– I think perspective is so important, and looking back, I feel like no matter the rejections you get, no matter the ‘no's you get, there's so much opportunity still out in front of you that's there for the taking.”</p>
<h2>Personal Reflections & Takeaways</h2>
<p>It is unlikely that most students will follow the same exact path as Dr. Kane. With that said, his story can provide valuable insights into the process of career exploration, and transition from the world of academia to your vocational destination. In college– especially among the fields of STEM– there exists a strong culture of setting far-out goals and pursuing them methodically, by systematically checking the boxes of the pre-med/nursing/engineering– you name it– requirements and expectations. In doing so, it becomes difficult to open your eyes and mind to other possibilities, and to allow yourself to explore your own interests. This is often driven by anxieties for job stability and expectations from peers and family.</p>
<p>Kane’s story, however, shows the possibility for flexibility and genuine curiosity (as well as, of course, determination and hard work) to lead you on your journey to self-actualization. Motivated by a deep appreciation for Chemistry, he pursued a PhD in faith that he’ll find his calling along the way; this venture led him to a profession that, while less-traditional- incorporates his passions in an incredibly societally-contributive manner.  Kane’s story shows that by opening our eyes to the many opportunities that surround us, and letting ourselves explore our interests and passions, we may find that our aptitudes and interests converge in a different place than we initially thought.</p>
<p>Writing this, I am reminded of Robert Frost’s infamous poem, “The Road Not Taken,” in which he writes:</p>
<p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.</p>
<p>To students currently in the process of determining future plans, let this serve as a reminder to open yourself up to new opportunities and experiences in your academic environment. With that, remember to forge relationships and a network of people, from whom you can learn and receive guidance. Aim to let yourself enjoy the process, but also challenge yourself– embrace the uncertainties and dive into them– and develop your skills and experiences; these will only aid you in your future pursuits. Lastly, take it all in proportion. Some choices are more monumental than others. That said, when one door closes, you can always find a new door to try to unlock.</p>

        excerpt: "Using the universe's oldest light to piece together our cosmic origins from Brazil to NASA."
        content: `<p>With the ever growing amount of information in the world, our understanding of the most complex systems can be enhanced through interdisciplinary connections. The following work explores Complexity Science, examples of collaborations, and ways to begin to expand your systems thinking in your own work.</p>
<h2>What is Complexity Science?</h2>
<p>How is it possible for the migration of birds, atomic fusion, and neural networks to be connected? Yes, on the surface these are wildly different phenomena that require intensive study to understand. Yet, viewed through the lens of Complexity Science, these seemingly disparate fields become unknowingly intertwined. .</p>
<p>Put simply, Complexity Science argues that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”</p>
<p>More formally, Complexity Science is the study of how large networks of components interact and produce emergent phenomena that are self-organizing. Think of the brain, an extraordinarily complex system, that relies on the interactions of neurons which themselves are simplistic. We can visualize the structure of the neuron under a microscope, and we can understand its molecular components– and yet, to comprehend how such a cell can give rise to what we experience as consciousness– is inexplicable without considering the surrounding system. Complexity Science argues that understanding the interactions between individual parts, enables scientists to unearth hidden information in the system, and form a comprehensive picture of the greater reality.</p>
<p>ree</p>
<p>Unlike some of the more “traditional” forms of sciences that are more commonly taught in academic environments, Complexity Science uniquely draws on seemingly distant and disparate disciplines. Though perhaps difficult to grasp conceptually, exploring Complexity in action can provide a clearer picture of the concept.</p>
<p>Mind over Matter</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, Complexity Science describes the study of emergent phenomena from simplistic parts. One of the most prominent examples of this is human intelligence. Although we can study individual pathways and neurons, we still have no explanation for the robustness of human thought.</p>
<p>In the public’s eye, the term ‘neural network’ has been synonymous with Artificial Intelligence since the late 2010s revolution in Deep Learning models. The term describes the various connected layers within an algorithm that attempt to mimic the logic of a human brain. The name itself tells the story of complexity at work. Based on the work of Stanford Neurophysiologist, Warren McCollugh, many computer scientists in the 19502 began imitating the structure of the brain, and developed mathematical and computational models that could program machines to perform similar processes. Advancements were made, with one of the biggest leaps occurring when David Rumelhart, a Psychologist developed Propagated Networks, in order to extend the “thinking” to multiple layers of neurons. Now widely recognized as one of the most important advancements in the last few decades, many forget the origins of deep neural networks that helped to develop programs like ChatGPT lay in an entirely different field, illustrating the underlying inspiration that complexity sciences affords.</p>

<p>The Art of the Connection (How to Apply Everyday)</p>
<p>In abstract discussions, these ideas may now be clear, but you may be wondering how to apply this information in your own scientific pursuits.</p>
<p>Keep up with your Interests - Many feel a  need to sacrifice their interests in other fields, due to the preconceived idea that a “jack of all trades” is a “master of none.” However, Complexity Science demonstrates the benefits of developing understandings in various areas. When taking classes or pursuing minors adjacent to your main field, think about how these topics might connect. Becoming an expert in one field is important, but it is likewise valuable to foment a basic understanding for surrounding disciplines.</p>
<p>Cross-Pollinate - As aspiring innovators in STEM fields, many of us will face opportunities to attend diverse conferences and events, many of which will likely focus on topics outside our specific field. Fellow Biomedical Engineers– for example– do not be afraid to learn more about insect biology and host-microbe Interactions. Public Health students don't shy away from topics like chemistry or physics.</p>
<p>Look outside of STEM - Even beyond the diverse fields of STEM, there remains an abundance of other fields that may hold extremely lucrative information for discoveries. Economics, Music, International Affairs and Media Studies all uncover thought provoking answers to the questions of Complexity. How can the growth of cities mirror the migration of birds? How does the volatility weather patterns help predict the rise of certain stocks? Complexity Science urges us to view each of these unique subjects as part of a greater whole; as students with the opportunity to expand our breadth of knowledge, look for ways to form a more comprehensive picture of our world, by engaging with a range of disciplines.</p>
<h2>The Main Takeaway?</h2>
<p>“I think the next [21st] century will be the century of complexity" – Stephen Hawking Complexity Science is not only an emerging interdisciplinary field, but also a thought provoking exercise in every scientist’s ability to see the bigger picture. Many problems that appear unsolvable on their surface– the origins of evolution, the cure to cancer, nuclear fusion– may in fact be solvable through cross-pollination over other fields. If anything, Complexity Science commands each of us to step outside our comfort zones and view our work in the light of others’.</p>

        content: `<p>“You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future” - Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Every scientist begins their journey with a general sense of direction, attempting to become an expert in one field.  However, it is not always obvious what path your interests will lead you down. In many cases, this induces anxiety for those pursuing a career in STEM, as we are told to “figure out what you want to do” for the rest of your life. Sitting down with Professor Michael Keidar, we will trace the steps of his illustrious career backwards, learning about how he tackled these exact questions that landed him to work in applying his knowledge across diverse fields such as brain tumor therapy, satellite design, and electromagnetic-induced drug delivery.</p>
<h2>Plasma and Purpose: The Multifaceted Journey of Dr. Michael Keidar</h2>
<p>Who: Professor Michael Keidar is The James A. Clark Professor of Mechanical Engineering at George Washington University. His main research interests focus on designing optimized propulsion technology for spacecrafts such as satellites, and developing nanoscale plasma technology. Despite this, some of his most well-known work was his application of cold plasmas in cancer therapy, demonstrating his ability to apply his work across fields. Professor Keidar completed his PhD at Tel Aviv University and Postdoc appointments at UC Berkeley and Cornell University. He recently received a DARPA grant to develop low flying satellites powered by atmospheric pressure differences.</p>
<p>Why: Many believe a scientific career is limited to either purely basic research or theoretical expertise. However, Dr. Keidar demonstrates that one can be a trailblazer in both fundamental research and make an impact on the lives of others. Furthermore, his career showcases the importance of obtaining valuable skills that can be applied across fields, unlocking the potential to maintain interdisciplinary interests. Many of us can benefit from hearing the story of such an impactful scientist, who continues to trailblaze almost 30 years after he began.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Fourth State of Matter: Plasma’s Role in the Universe</h2>
<p>Micropropulsion of Satellites. Cancer Therapy. Electromagnetic Induced Cellular Responses.</p>
<p>To the naked eye, these are wildly different fields, each separated by vast oceans of knowledge. However, Michael Keidar sees them all connected through the unifying state of the universe: plasma.</p>
<p>The three states of matter — solid, liquid, and gas — are commonly taught in Middle School science. However, the state that makes up over 99% of the universe, plasma, is almost always forgotten.</p>
<p>Plasma is likely omitted from the standard middle school curriculum because it requires a deeper understanding of electromagnetic forces and ionization, both of which are taught in High School. Moving forward in our understanding of the world, we begin to learn about plasma, the state of matter that makes up over 99% of the universe. Everything from lightning to stars to fluorescent light bulbs is made of plasma.</p>
<p>To create plasma, a gas is superheated, leading many of the electrons to be stripped away. This induces an electrical imbalance on the gas particles that generate what we call “plasma.” Thus, plasma consists of highly energized particles, producing electrically conductive material that interacts strongly with the electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>And here lies the secret to the story of plasmas. The interaction of the highly charged species of particles in plasmas within the electromagnetic field induces an electromagnetic interaction. The fundamental ideas of plasma are the dots that Keidar connects throughout his career.</p>
<h2>Lightning Strikes: How Plasma Found Michael Keidar</h2>
<p>Growing up in the USSR during the Cold War, Keidar was brought up in the thick of the Space Age. Naturally, Keidar began to ask questions about the fundamentals of spacecraft propulsion from a young age. From these interests, he completed his undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering with a focus on electrical space propulsion from the Kharkov Aviation Institute. His education focused primarily on practical applications, centering on designing more propulsion systems for efficient satellites to save energy and conserve space.</p>
<p>“At that time, [it] was considered quite advanced,” Keidar said. “The idea was to use electricity instead of heating fuel and oxidizer, you can reach much higher velocities and use less… but there are downsides as electricity is limited on satellites.”</p>
<p>Here, at the end of his undergraduate degree, he saw the first possibilities of plasma, beginning to study more fundamental questions dealing with the nature of plasmas as opposed to their application. After completing his PhD in Plasma Engineering at Tel Aviv University, Keidar could now focus more on using the natural properties of plasma to produce advancements. Due to the highly charged and extremely conductive fundamental properties of plasmas, Keidar produced work that harnessed these properties to propel spacecraft through the repulsive properties of the electromagnetic field..</p>
<p>The shift toward more plasma-centered research was furthered by two postdoc appointments at UC Berkeley and Cornell research labs. Now, after almost a decade of research under his belt and a transition toward plasma research, Keidar has amassed unparalleled expertise in the field. Yet, his desire to make advancements in applying these technologies never went away.</p>
<p>Pursuing a Professorship at GW, Keidar simultaneously opened a research lab that married his interests in plasma research and aerospace propulsion. The Micropropulsion and Nanoparticles Lab helped focus his interests on extremely small spacecraft and plasma-based nanoparticles. Despite this, Keidar could not expect where his career would turn from here…</p>
<h2>Cold Plasmas: A Paradigm Shift</h2>
<p>Almost accidentally, Professor Keidar entered the Biomedical field in a momentous fashion. At the time, in the late 2010s, there was no Department of Biomedical Engineering at GW, yet there was a Biomedical Institute that funded several projects in other departments for biomedical research. Despite being housed in the Mechanical Engineering Department, Keidar sought projects that had biomedical applications for his plasma research. Here, he envisioned working with his “cold” plasmas.</p>
<p>“We started to develop what we call cold plasmas. Typical plasma in a lab is millions of degrees Celsius; the trick here is to apply a very strong electromagnetic field, which creates positive ions extremely quickly, allowing for an energetic, room temperature plasma.”</p>
<p>The resulting cold plasma is a cocktail of reactive species, oxygen, nitrogen, and ozone compounds, all present in both the human body and the atmosphere. The creation of these charged species acts as a reservoir that can be called, if necessary, to correct some biological processes. In short, with a cold plasma induced in a cell, these necessary compounds can be delivered without harming the cell.</p>
<p>The possibility to induce the creation of these species then affected the pattern of cell migration. “We alter the migration of cells and thought, maybe this would be good to slow down the migration of cells from tumor areas.” Through experiments at Johns Hopkins University, plasma therapy was found to selectively kill cancerous cells. This discovery led to the FDA approval of Canady Helios Cold Plasma to develop plasma therapy into a commercially viable product.</p>
<p>To this day, his plasma medicine research is still his most cited paper, although this remains outside of his “Foundational Work”. Despite this, the dots still connect, as all of this was possible from his understanding of Plasma Fundamentals.</p>
<p>The Marriage of Propulsion and Therapy</p>
<p>After his stint focusing on biomedical applications, Keidar returned to the questions that had begun his career: Can we fly satellites low enough in orbit that the air they collect can be converted to plasma and used to cancel out the drag produced by the spacecraft? Typically, with plasma-induced propulsion, ions are expelled and induce a “jet effect”. Issues arise when the positive ions are ejected, as they take the positive charge and leave the satellite negatively charged. On large scales, such as a satellite, this induces such a large negative electrical differential that the positively charged particles are attracted back to the spacecraft, inhibiting the electromagnetic force.</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, Keidar had to look back on his fundamental understanding of plasma physics and atmospheric chemical interactions. Put simply, how can oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere help to solve this problem? One effect of oxygen at low energy is that electrons actually attach to oxygen atoms more strongly than the positively charged ions from the spacecraft. Thus, an expulsion of oxygen could potentially counterbalance the ionic buildup of negative charges.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, Keidar needed to call on his previous biomedical work, which involved understanding the same interactions but on a cellular level. When developing the cold plasma cancer therapy research, the interactions between all the induced chemical species from the plasma needed to be monitored to determine the side effects of the treatment. Now, with this database of chemical interactions, it was possible for Keidar to predict the outcomes of his plasma’s effects more precisely. These same species are the ones that interact in the Atmosphere.</p>
<p>Once again, Keidar proves how the dots continue to connect long after the dots begin to appear.</p>
<h2>Push the Needle Forward: Dr. Keidar’s Wisdom for Aspiring Scientists</h2>
<p>When asked to reflect on his career and any advice he’d give to aspiring scientists, Keidar focused on watering those curious questions that every scientist needs to have in order to succeed.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to develop your direction when you chase the inconsistent interests of others, but you must resist that urge.”</p>
<p>Now, at this stage in his career, as a Professor in the capital of the United States, he often finds the interests of others clouding his line of sight. NIH, NSF, DOE, DARPA, DOD, all government agencies that Michael Keidar has worked with to help advance the questions he chooses to attack. Although these groups are important in setting a trend in research, Keidar emphasizes the even greater importance of pursuing meaningful research that is both novel and applicable to real problems faced in these fields</p>
<p>“Above all I recommend that people do not chase. Push the needle toward what you believe in”</p>
<p>For aspiring scientists, becoming an “expert” in a field is an honor and a dream. To be able to help push forward your tiny corner of STEM is the goal of all professional scientists. At every stage of his career, Dr Keidar pursued what he believed was going to advance the lives of others.  His career has touched fields from brain tumors to satellite development. It begins to show the ever-growing collaborative nature of science, as not distinct disciplines but an orchestra of moving parts. To be able to say you push forward multiple fields, now this is the mark of a very special scientist.</p>
<p>The more we study extraordinary people, the more we learn about the importance of connecting the dots. For Jobs, this was merging calligraphy into the design of his first Macintosh Computer. For Professor Michael Keidar, it is exploring the secrets of the fourth state of matter in the universe: plasma.</p>
<h2>My Own Reflections & Takeaways</h2>
<p>To me- an aspiring scientist with the expectations of a scientific career placed before me- I was moved by Professor Keidar’s story of creativity and curiosity across the numerous areas of research he has entered. I believe that in the face of an ever increasingly dynamic world, it is important to build skills that can transcend the static barriers of strict categories and instead pursue fundamental interests that can open the doors in even more ways.</p>
<p>For each of us, it is important to take a deep breath and follow our interests, constantly pushing to understand not just the surface, but the underlying mechanisms. Through understanding the core of any field, we can each unlock abilities to further our understanding of the applications of fundamental sciences and their impact on our society. I began with the Steve Jobs quote, legendarily spoken at the Stanford Commencement in 2005, and I believe the end of that quote helps to encapsulate this story as well:</p>
<p>“Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path.”</p>
<p>To all the students currently trying to figure out what field they want to enter, what PhD program to enter, what research lab they want to join, or even what classes they want to take next semester, remember to follow your interests and think of the bigger picture. Nurture your curiosity and water your creativity, and remember that when in doubt, have faith that your dots will connect, even when you can’t see how.</p>

        excerpt: "Leading expert Dr. Henry Kaminski guides us through the latest breakthroughs in MG treatment."
        content: `<p>Three researchers in Washington, D.C., are currently shaping our future through groundbreaking advancements in technology and medicine. From revolutionizing computing with brain-shaped technology and developing innovative treatments for multiple sclerosis to advancing therapies for aggressive breast cancer, these efforts are pushing the boundaries of science as we know it.</p>
<p>Distinguished researchers like Dr. Gina Adam, Dr. Jeffrey Huang, and Dr. Barry Hudson are pioneering cutting-edge research that expands modern scientific understanding and offers tangible solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges — all from the nation’s capital.</p>
<p>Dr. Gina Adam – Neuromorphic Computing and Nanotechnology</p>
<p>As the world advances in its technological capabilities through powerful tools like AI, the search for more effective and advanced computing systems only grows. Dr. Gina Adam, an Assistant Professor at George Washington University, is working to develop neuromorphic computing and nanotechnology toward this aim.</p>
<p>The word “neuromorphic” can be broken down into the Greek words neûron, meaning “string, nerve” and referring to the brain, and morphē, meaning “shape.” Simply put, neuromorphic computing employs computational methods to mimic the function of the brain by simulating the neural and synaptic processes it performs.</p>
<p>Dr. Adam’s work focuses on developing “memristors,” which she describes as resistors with memory to recall how much charge they’ve passed. Meanwhile, traditional computers process information using a rigid structure of transistors and binary code of zeroes and ones. Although this approach has worked thus far, it is less effective with higher-complexity tasks like pattern recognition and real-time learning, and when it does attempt those complex tasks, it consumes vast amounts of energy. This limitation lies in how the transistors use sequential processing for information. Imagine that a large image is placed in front of someone. As soon as their eyes see it, the brain processes the information on several tracks — an ability called parallel processing — such that the experience stimulates pathways that evoke feelings from the amygdala, perception in the occipital cortex, and memory recall in the hippocampus. Transistors, however, must process each pixel one by one, requiring extensive time and energy.</p>

<h2>So, How Do Memristors Work?</h2>
<p>The key to a memristor’s memory lies in resistive switching, which is typically achieved through ion migration or phase changes in the material. The most common way scientists use them to “remember information” is through ion migration, which occurs when an applied voltage creates or fills oxygen vacancies (missing atoms) of metal oxides such as titanium dioxide or hafnium oxide inside the memristor, creating new conductive pathways or removing old ones, effectively “encoding” a retained memory state even after the current information is terminated. Unlike binary logic, memristors can process a range of values, enabling them to perform parallelized tasks like image and speech recognition.</p>
<p>How Dr. Adam’s Work is Revolutionizing Computing</p>
<p>One of Dr. Adam’s most notable developments is 3D memristor crossbar arrays — a design that stacks memristors into layers, improving their efficiency. Currently, her lab focuses on integrating a novel category of memristors called ReRAM switches. These two-terminal electronic devices incorporate resistive switching, which involves a dielectric material that can rapidly adjust its resistance into arrays and dense matrices when sufficient voltage is applied.</p>
<p>The ability to stack and integrate memristors together offers immense potential for the development of smaller, smarter, and more efficient devices with higher processing capacities per unit space. This revolutionary design additionally offers potential to develop an energy-efficient data center capable of processing massive data inputs using only a fraction of its current power consumption. Finally, the “memory” stored in these devices may also provide a unique ability to give them “digital fingerprints,” making them less vulnerable to malicious hackers and cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>Dr. Adam’s innovative research in neuromorphic computing and nanotechnology is forging a new path in the development of high-functioning and high-processing machines. Her work is paving the way for a new generation of AI-powered technologies with the capacity to shape industries and improve countless lives.</p>
<p>Dr. Jeffrey Huang – Advancements in Multiple Sclerosis Treatment</p>
<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease affecting roughly 2.8 million people worldwide, according to the National MS Society in 2019. Over time, the disease causes progressive nerve damage, physical disability, and cognitive decline. Despite decades of research, scientists have struggled to develop effective treatments capable of repairing years’ worth of nerve damage. Dr. Jeffrey Huang, an Associate Professor of Biology at Georgetown University, is spearheading innovative research that may offer hope for MS patients in the nation’s capital.</p>
<p>A hallmark feature of MS that underlies many of its symptoms is the demyelination of neurons. Like a computer, the neurons of the brain and spinal cord use electricity to communicate with one another and mediate quick information processing. In order to maximize their communication speed, many neuronal fibers are insulated by myelin sheaths, a fatty layer of Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes that wrap themselves along the axons and prevent ions from diffusing out, maximizing their current speed. In MS, the immune system wrongly attacks and destroys these myelin, impairing neuronal communication drastically. Dr. Huang studies remyelination — the process of repairing these protective myelin sheaths — and his discoveries in neuroinflammation and brain repair mechanisms have paved the way for new therapies and redefined our prior understanding of the brain’s innate ability to heal itself.</p>
<p>Multiple Sclerosis by blueringmedia</p>
<h2>Why is Remyelination Critical?</h2>
<p>Many of the symptoms observed in MS, such as muscle weakness, impaired coordination of movements, and vision problems, result from the slowed signaling that occurs upon loss of myelin. Moreover, the high energy required for the neurons to communicate following the loss of the myelin sheaths makes them especially vulnerable to a process called excitotoxicity, which causes neuronal death.</p>
<p>Current treatments mainly focus on suppressing the immune response, which helps to slow the progression of MS, but does not address the underlying demyelination issue. Some of Dr. Huang’s most significant contributions to MS research elucidate the crucial role of microglia, the brain’s resident immune cell, in clearing damaged myelin and promoting its repair. His research shows that when appropriately activated, microglia release cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that support the maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, enabling them to produce myelin and repair some of the nerve damage.</p>
<p>In 2023, Dr. Huang and his team developed a drug that successfully reversed the effects of late-stage MS in animal models. Utilizing the compound JPH034, an inhibitor of the LAT1 transporter, the drug effectively reduces the quantity of pro-inflammatory factors that induce microglia to cause damage. As inflammation is relieved, OPCs successfully mature and re-myelinate neurons, essentially repairing the damage caused by the disease.</p>
<p>As Dr. Huang’s research continues to progress from animal models to clinical applications, it has the potential to transform the lives of millions of MS patients, helping them restore their healthy neurological function and slow the progression of their disease.</p>
<h2>Dr. Barry Hudson – Targeting Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</h2>
<p>In the realm of oncology, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains an intimidating challenge that affects countless women. In fact, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that about 2,088,849 cases of TNBC were recorded in 2018, making it a common cancer in women. TNBC is a particularly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that derives its name from the fact that it lacks the three receptors commonly targeted in breast cancer treatments: estrogen, which controls female sexual and reproductive development, progesterone, which regulates the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and other aspects of reproduction, and HER2, a protein that controls cell growth. The absence of these receptors makes conventional hormonal therapies ineffective in TNBC, leaving patients with minimal options for treatment and a pressing need for innovative approaches.</p>
<p>At Georgetown University, Dr. Barry Hudson, an Associate Professor in the Department of Oncology, is leading impactful research that has the potential to transform TNBC treatment.</p>
<p>Targeting Inflammatory Pathways in TNBC</p>
<p>Dr. Hudson’s laboratory is researching the relationship between inflammation and breast cancer metastasis. His work focuses on the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), a multi-ligand receptor that binds to harmful molecules called Glycation End-products (AGEs). These molecules, which are secreted due to factors like aging, stress, and high blood pressure, accumulate as waste products in the body.</p>
<h2>Why does RAGE matter?</h2>
<p>When AGEs bind to RAGE, they trigger inflammation and oxidative stress, which can further prompt the progression of various diseases, such as cancer, diabetes complications, and heart disease. Even though the body can typically clear AGEs, the overactivation of RAGE in TNBC causes persistent inflammation and damage, which increases tumor growth by stimulating cell division, enhancing metastasis of the cancer and allowing it to spread to other parts of the body.</p>
<p>Targeting RAGE</p>
<p>Dr. Hudson’s laboratory has developed novel RAGE inhibitors that have demonstrated potential in reducing inflammation and metastasis in animal models. Dr. Hudson and his team have repurposed a small-molecule RAGE inhibitor used for Alzheimer’s treatment, called TTP488 (Azeliragon), to assess its efficacy against TNBC.</p>
<p>Recent studies in mouse models of TNBC have demonstrated that Azeliragon effectively inhibits cancer metastasis to the lungs. Additionally, the inhibition of RAGE by Azeliragon disrupted key signaling pathways involved in tumor cell adhesion (Akt), migration (Pyk2), and invasion (STAT3), which are essential for reducing the risk of cancer metastasis.</p>
<p>Dr. Hudson’s innovative research on RAGE inhibition represents a promising avenue for treating TNBC. By repurposing Azeliragon, his work has the potential to revolutionize TNBC treatment, reduce the burden of metastatic disease, and provide more personalized and effective therapies. This innovative approach brings oncology researchers closer to improving the quality of life for those battling one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Pioneering Research That is Shaping the Future of Science and Medicine</p>
<p>The groundbreaking research conducted by Dr. Gina Adam, Dr. Jeffrey Huang, and Dr. Barry Hudson reveals the incredible power of innovation that occurs at the intersection of science, technology, and medicine. From advancing neuromorphic computing to pursuing curative therapies for Multiple Sclerosis and aggressive breast cancer, these scientists are at the forefront of paving a future that is more efficient, intelligent, and compassionate. The headquarters of these endeavours at the nation’s capital serves as a reminder that the innovations coming out of Washington, D.C., are not only advancing human knowledge but also offering tangible solutions that will enhance lives, fight disease, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>

        excerpt: "Combining deep cultural insight with scientific rigor to build inclusive global mental health systems."
        content: `<p>The position of working in the Capital of the United States offers unparalleled opportunities for those who want to effect change in medicine. Dr. Brent Harris is a physician-scientist whose work in neuropathology, brain sampling, and ALS has helped millions of Americans. His reach extends beyond traditional clinical care; his development of Brain Banks and promotion of legislation for ALS research has allowed Harris to leave a lasting mark on neurodegenerative disease research. It is pivotal to understand how Harris’ proximity to the nation’s capital has facilitated his ultimate goal as a Physician: to improve the lives of patients.</p>
<h2>Who is Dr. Brent Harris?</h2>
<p>Dr. Brent Harris is a Professor of Neuropathology at Georgetown University, and an Adjunct Associate Professor at both George Washington University and Howard University, whose current work focuses on neurodegeneration and the underlying influence of glial-neuronal relationships in the development of neurological diseases. From an early age, Harris loved both science and medicine and decided to pursue both, he said. As a physician-scientist, Dr. Harris’s work ranges from brain tissue lab research to extensive patient care. After completing his MD/PhD at Georgetown University, Harris conducted his Residency Pathology at Stanford University Medical School. Harris returned to his alma mater in 2010, this time as a Georgetown Medical School professor. He has since established the Georgetown Brain Bank and POND Bank, in addition to assuming the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for DC. Here he has been utilizing his proximity to the capital to initiate and lead many programs to advance the treatment and research for neuroinflammatory diseases including working with National organizations such as NIH.</p>
<h2>Why His Work Matters</h2>
<p>Above all, Dr. Harris epitomizes every physician's vocational heart and every scientist's curious mind, combining both professions to help investigate the most difficult questions about brain disease. Learning about how Dr. Harris has maintained a profound impact in both clinical and translational research settings can inspire future students to pursue careers that emphasize the importance of making an impact that will be felt across the intricate fields of biomedical sciences. Lastly, Dr. Harris’ commitment to service in battling brain disease nationwide, demonstrates the significance of working in Medicine in the capital of the United States.</p>
<p>The MD/PhD Journey</p>
<p>Before we can begin to understand Dr. Harris, we must first understand how he arrived at his current position. What is an MD/PhD? Why an MD/PhD? And what is a Neuropathologist? And funnily enough, Dr. Harris was once sitting in your exact seats asking the exact same questions.</p>
<p>Like many, Dr. Harris was a fan of science and medicine but was confused as to where these loves would lead him. In undergraduate, he pursued a Liberal Arts degree and balanced this with courses in the natural sciences. Before long, he found himself in a Summer program at the National Institutes of Health and decided he was going to pursue a career in the biomedical sciences. Once he completed a Master's in Biochemistry, he decided he finally was ready to apply to Medical School and devote his career in Medicine.</p>
<p>However, he did not want to leave science behind. Thus, he applied to pursue an MD/PhD. The MD/PhD is a combined program offered at many Medical Schools in order to train a unique group of Physician-Scientists, Doctors who can interface between the worlds of clinical and basic research, offering a wide expertise across a range of disciplines. Dr. Harris applied to Georgetown Medical School and pursued an MD/PhD in Neuroscience, citing the Brain as the “Final Frontier” in Medicine.</p>
<p>Faced with the decision of residency, Dr. Harris could choose Neurology, the study of diagnosing and managing disorders of the nervous system; Psychiatry, focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions; Neurosurgery, involving surgical interventions to treat diseases of the brain and spinal cord; or Neuropathology, the microscopic study of nervous system tissues to understand disease at the cellular level. Ultimately he found Neuropathology to be the most complimentary for understanding the core mechanisms of the brain’s functions as well as an avenue for critical support in all aspects of medicine.</p>
<p>“You kind of break down neuropathology into the clinical aspects, the teaching aspects and the research aspects,” Harris said. “I chose neuropathology because I enjoy doing all three of those things.”</p>
<p>After making this leap into the unknown, Dr. Harris continued his career with stints in Residency at Stanford Medical Center and working at Dartmouth University. Only after this period, did Dr Harris finally return to DC, once again working in his Alma Mater of Georgetown University.</p>
<p>“I choose the last unknown frontier in medicine, the neurosciences when deciding where I wanted to spend the next 40-50 years”</p>
<p>Building Bridges with Brain Banks</p>
<p>After arriving in Washington DC, Dr. Harris began to understand the real nature of his responsibility as a physician-scientist. With training in both basic research and clinical care, Dr. Harris serves as a unique thoroughfare between the worlds of science and medicine. Naturally, Dr. Harris began to become involved in a myriad of programs and initiatives that he could lend his specific blend of expertise.</p>
<p>Enter Brain Banks, a physical database to host specimens of brain tissue used for basic research. He describes them as “banks” in the truest sense, where clinical data, tissue, and fluids are carefully collected, classified, and stored for future research. This process allows researchers to study diseases like ALS at an unprecedented depth, leveraging tools like genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics —“Any omics you can think of,” as Dr. Harris describes.</p>
<p>These advanced approaches, combined with the use of patient tissue, are unlocking critical insights into disease mechanisms, particularly neuroinflammation and the interplay between glial and neuronal cells that drive ALS progression. Oftentimes researchers can discern the presence of hereditary diseases through the proper use of brain banks when connected to deceased family members. Here Dr. Harris can merge his two expertise, as he can clinically consent and work with the patients and then utilize his background in pathology to collect and understand tissue samples.</p>
<p>However, the ability to host and store these tissues is quite difficult, considering the IRB approval necessary to collect the tissues and the economic upkeep of the physical space of these sensitive gigabytes of information. Here, Dr. Harris sets himself apart due to his unwavering commitment to the public good and the use of his resources. Through Georgetown’s prominence in the U.S. capital, Dr. Harris has been able to continually fight for grants to upkeep the Georgetown Brain Bank and simultaneously start new initiatives across the United States. With developments in Machine Learning and improving the speed of analysis and the accuracy of reports, each brain tissue is becoming increasingly more valuable in the information they can provide. Therefore, Dr. Harris and his team’s work is not only actively supporting patients directly, but indirectly leading to discoveries in labs across the nation. Dr Harris recognizes that a paper can only do so much and through providing tissue samples to other researchers, he exponentially advances the research for neurodegenerative diseases one brain at a time.</p>
<h2>Targeting ALS: From Lab Work to Legislative Action</h2>
<p>Dr. Harris’s work extends beyond the lab and brain bank, reflecting his unwavering commitment to understanding and combating devastating neurological diseases. Currently Dr. Harris finds his most far-reaching work through the legislative initiatives started by governmental organizations. As part of the ALL ALS initiative, Dr. Harris played a pivotal role in passing legislation to bolster funding and accessibility for brain banks and research sites across the United States. This initiative represents a monumental leap in uniting clinical and translational research, enabling 35 sites nationwide to collect brain tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. These resources are critical for identifying early biomarkers and therapeutic targets, with the ultimate goal of transforming ALS from a fatal disease into a treatable condition. The ALL ALS initiative exemplifies the power of "team science," where neurologists, molecular biologists, and bioengineers collaborate to address one of neuroscience’s most pressing challenges. Dr. Harris underscores that this collaborative approach allows for the integration of diverse expertise, which is essential to tackling the complex mechanisms underlying ALS.</p>
<p>Dr. Harris’s dedication to advancing ALS research is also evident in his leadership of the Target ALS program. This initiative was created to address a significant gap in ALS research: the availability of high-quality tissues and biofluids for scientific study. As a neuropathologist and Director of the Georgetown Brain Bank, Dr. Harris has championed the importance of brain banks as foundational tools in research. For Dr. Harris, neuropathology is more than a field—it is a vocation that bridges science and medicine. His work highlights the critical role of neuropathologists as collaborators and stewards of human tissue, advancing both research and patient care. As he explains, neuropathologists are uniquely positioned to teach others about the human aspect of diseases and their pathological underpinnings. By enabling researchers to access high-quality, anonymized samples, Dr. Harris’s brain bank supports scientific discovery and honors the profound generosity of donors and their families. This ethos extends to his research, where he uses advanced molecular biology and cutting-edge tools like machine learning to explore how glial cells contribute to disease. Dr. Harris’s work is a testament to the transformative potential of neuropathology, uniting clinical insight and scientific inquiry to combat ALS and other neurological diseases.</p>
<p>Key Highlights and Takeaways</p>
<p>Dr. Harris’ path and experience represent a crucial identity that all aspiring scientists should have - your work is a vocation. The centrality of this premise is represented through the extremely diverse body of work that Dr. Harris has accumulated throughout his long career. Through legislative initiatives, symposiums and basic research the scope of his efforts to help patients through their neurodegenerative diseases is immense.</p>
<p>In addition, being a leading physician and investigator in Washington, D.C. has allowed Dr. Harris to promote his research on a national and international level. As Harris said, “There is no place I would rather be” when I asked why he continued to pursue his research and work in the Capital of the United States. Dr Harris reminds all of us that our unique interests can be melded together and in fact beneficial to our careers. Moreover, sometimes the most valuable thing we can do is put ourselves in the right place to let our work impact the most people.</p>

        excerpt: "Scientist Riley Leff dives deep into the hidden strategies trees use to survive extreme stress."
        content: `<p>Nestled in the d-block of the periodic table, transition metals profoundly shape the vibrant world we see. While organic chemistry often captures the spotlight with its intricate molecules and reactions, the dazzling contributions of transition metals remain one of nature’s best-kept secrets. From the rich hues of gemstones to the molecular mechanisms of blood, these elements weave color into both the mundane and the extraordinary.</p>
<h2>Nature’s Timeless Palette: A Brief History of Transition Metals</h2>
<p>The story of transition metals intertwines with humanity’s enduring fascination with color. Their vivid hues have pervaded art and culture since antiquity.</p>
<p>Long before synthetic dyes emerged, ochre stood out as an ancient earth-derived pigment. Composed of iron oxide, ochre’s color varies with its mineral form—from hematite-red (α-Fe₂O₃) to goethite-yellow (α-FeO(OH)). Archeological discoveries, such as the ochre-stained artifacts in Qafzeh Cave, Israel, suggest that early humans used these pigments in rituals as far back as 100,000 years. For ancient societies, ochre was more than a pigment, it symbolized life, death, and cultural expression.</p>
<p>Today, the legacy of transition metals lives on in art, whether in the copper greens of Renaissance paintings or the cobalt blues of stained glass. Their vibrant impact is as timeless as it is scientific.</p>
<h2>Metallic Masterpieces: How Transition Metals Paint Biochemistry</h2>
<p>Transition metals not only color our history but also animate the chemistry of life. Their secret lies in their partially filled d-orbitals, which allow these elements to interact with other molecules in unique ways. Transition metals can form coordination complexes, which occur when they bond with ligands—molecules or ions that donate a pair of electrons to the metal. This bonding changes the electronic structure of the metal ion, which in turn affects how it interacts with light. As light shines on a coordination complex, specific wavelengths are absorbed while others are reflected. The reflected light is what gives these complexes their brilliant colors.</p>
<h2>Breathing Color: Hemoglobin and Hemocyanin</h2>
<p>Transition metals are at the heart of respiratory pigments, making life possible. Hemoglobin, the oxygen-transporting molecule of our blood, binds oxygen via its iron-centered heme groups, imparting blood’s characteristic red hue. This hue shifts with oxygenation, appearing bright red when oxygen-rich and darker red when oxygen-poor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile other animals like horseshoe crabs owe their striking blue blood to hemocyanin, a copper-based oxygen carrier. Copper’s unique electronic interactions create this distinct hue, illustrating the versatility of transition metals in biochemistry.</p>
<h2>Decoding Crystal Field Splitting</h2>
<p>The vibrant hues of transition metals are rooted in the behavior of their d-orbitals—regions around the metal ion where electrons reside. When ligands surround a transition metal ion to form a coordination complex, they create an electric field that influences the energy levels of the d-orbitals. Crystal Field Theory (CFT) provides a framework for understanding how the spatial arrangement of ligands around a metal ion perturbs the energy of its d-orbitals.</p>
<h2>How Splitting Works</h2>
<p>Imagine six ligands surrounding a transition metal ion in an octahedral geometry—with ligands at the six points of an imaginary octahedron. While the d-orbitals of the metal ion experience electrostatic repulsion from the negatively charged electron clouds of the ligands, this interaction isn’t uniform. Orbitals that align directly with the ligands (dz2 and dx2-y2) experience greater electrostatic repulsion and become higher-energy eg orbitals. Orbitals that lie between ligand axes (dxy, dxz, dyz) experience less repulsion and form lower-energy t2g orbitals. The energy difference between these sets of orbitals is called the crystal field splitting energy (Δoct) and is key to a complex’s color.</p>
<p>When white light hits a transition metal complex, electrons in the lower-energy t2g orbitals absorb photons (packets of light) and jump to the higher-energy eg orbitals. The wavelength of light absorbed depends on the size of Δoct, which varies based on the metal ion, its oxidation state, and the ligands attached. The unabsorbed light reflects back to our eyes, creating the color we perceive.</p>
<p>The precise color of a transition metal complex is like a chemical fingerprint, shaped by the identity of the metal ion, its oxidation state, and the nature of its ligands. Each variable contributes to the unique interaction of light with the complex, creating an endless spectrum of possibilities.</p>
<p>Spinning Electrons, Painting the World</p>
<p>From Renaissance paintings to modern dyes, transition metals have transformed the way we see and create color. Transition metals bridge the gap between the microscopic and the macroscopic, turning the subtle movements of electrons into a vivid tapestry of color. So, the next time you marvel at a gemstone or catch the glimmer of a vibrant hue in nature, take a moment to appreciate the chemistry behind it—transition metals spinning their invisible dance to create the visible wonders of our world.</p>

        content: `<p>Dr. John Hawdon didn’t set out to study parasites, but life has a funny way of leading the curious down paths they never expected. A stack of rejection letters, an unplanned teaching job, a retired greyhound with a stubborn infection, and the wisdom of a Haitian voodoo priest—none of it was part of the plan.</p>
<p>Dr. Hawdon’s Winding Path to Parasitology</p>
<p>Dr. John Hawdon in a blue shirt smiling, standing by a large glass window in GW's Science and Engineering Hall. Bright, neutral lighting creates a cheerful mood.</p>
<p>Dr. John Hawdon (photo from The Hawdon Lab) As a young boy with a love for animals and biology, veterinary science seemed like the natural choice for Dr. John Hawdon. However, as he advanced in his collegiate studies, he found himself captivated by something else entirely. In the 1970s, molecular biology captured his attention through its cutting-edge transformation of the field of biological research with breakthroughs in gene cloning and recombinant DNA. However, as a senior, Dr. Hawdon had already declared an animal science degree.</p>
<p>With little time to spare, he decided to get creative and reached out to a research lab, only to learn that a prerequisite course stood in his way. Not one to shy away from a challenge, Dr. Hawdon completed the requirement and secured a position in the lab, hoping to gain hands-on experience to strengthen his graduate school applications for molecular biology. But life, like science, doesn’t always go as planned, and his applications were met with rejection.</p>
<p>Forced to pivot, Dr. Hawdon took a teaching job at a proprietary technical school—not an obvious stepping stone into research, but it paid the bills. His schedule was relentless, teaching five courses a day, five days a week, but in the midst of that relentless schedule, fate quietly intervened. One of the courses he taught was parasitology, and those parasites were … interesting. For Dr. Hawdon, these organisms pointed to a field rich with questions waiting to be answered.</p>
<p>In the meantime, after two years of persistent effort in pursuit of research, Dr. Hawdon landed a position at the University of Pittsburgh, where he worked with C. elegans, a microscopic nematode, or roundworm making waves in biological research. Through this research, Dr. Hawdon realized his true interests lay in worms with direct consequences for human health, and just like that, his passion for parasitology clicked into focus.</p>
<p>With a renewed sense of determination, Dr. Hawdon pursued graduate studies in parasitology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he met Peter Hotez, a rising figure in vaccine development for parasitic diseases. Their collaboration led Dr. Hawdon to a postdoctoral position at Yale University’s MacArthur Center for Molecular Parasitology, and soon after, he became an Associate Research Scientist in the Medical Helminthology Laboratory in the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at Yale. Nine years later, he joined George Washington University, where he would carve out his own niche in the field.</p>
<p>With the support of his first independent grant, he pivoted from vaccine research and leaned into the molecular mechanisms of parasitic worms and their impact on human health. Over time, his work has helped shape the field of parasitology, inspiring a new generation of scientists. Reflecting on this, Dr. Hawdon calls it “a piece of big luck,” but more than luck, it was his persistence, adaptability, and readiness to follow wherever science led him.</p>
<p>When asked what piece of advice has guided his career, Dr. Hawdon shared his personal take on Louis Pasteur’s famous words:</p>
<p>"Serendipity favors the prepared mind."</p>
<p>Looking at his journey, it’s hard to disagree.</p>
<h2>Tackling a Growing Threat: Anthelmintic Resistance</h2>
<p>Today, Dr. Hawdon’s research focuses on tackling one of parasitology’s most pressing challenges: anthelmintic resistance. Anthelmintics, or anti-parasitic drugs, have historically been highly effective in treating helminthiasis—infections caused by helminths or parasitic worms—eliminating about 99% of susceptible helminths. However, misuse of anthelmintic drugs in agriculture and human medicine has fueled the emergence of drug-resistant strains, posing a serious threat to both human and animal health.</p>
<p>The consequences are especially dire within the livestock industry. Sheep farmers, for example, have long heavily relied on deworming treatments to prevent helminthiasis in their livestock. However, in some regions, the misuse of anthelmintics has spurred the evolution of resistant nematodes, devastating sheep farms worldwide. This raises concerns that, without alternative strategies to control resistance, conventional livestock farming could become unsustainable.</p>
<p>Dr. Hawdon’s lab is at the forefront of understanding the genetic mechanics driving resistance. In a 2024 publication, his team characterized a naturally occurring strain of Ancylostoma caninum, a canine hookworm, resistant to three major classes of anthelmintics and identified genetic mutations associated with the resistance. The lab also observed altered larval activation responses in the resistant strains, suggesting changes in the signaling pathways involved in the activation process. These findings may inform future strategies for managing drug-resistant hookworm populations.</p>
<p>Close-up of Ancylostoma caninum, a parasitic worm, set against a beige background, under magnification.</p>
<p>Ancylostoma caninum (photo by Andrea Langeland) Dr. Hawdon also notes the potential emergence of resistance in human medicine. While current treatments for helminthiasis are largely effective, early warning signs suggest that resistance may already be developing as some deworming programs have reported worrying declines in efficacy against human hookworm infections. Although this is not yet cause for alarm, these findings underscore the need for proactive solutions.</p>
<h2>Serendipity Strikes Again: The Greyhound Hookworm Mystery</h2>
<p>In 2014, a veterinarian informed Dr. Hawdon about a puzzling case: a retired greyhound with a persistent hookworm infection that no treatment could eliminate. Intrigued, he obtained a stool sample and began investigating. What he found was alarming—the hookworms were resistant to all three major drugs used to treat helminthiasis in dogs.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a fluke (literally—flukes are parasitic flatworms, but these were nematodes… 😉). Racing greyhounds, much like farmed sheep, undergo frequent deworming, which over time inadvertently selects for highly resistant worms. As the racing industry declined, many retired greyhounds were adopted into households, unknowingly bringing their “superworms” with them.</p>
<p>Building upon the discovery of multidrug-resistant hookworms in retired greyhounds, Dr. Hawdon's lab is diving deeper into the genetic basis of this resistance. Their research aims to develop better diagnostic tools and treatment strategies to combat these "superworms." By understanding the specific genetic mutations and altered biological pathways in these resistant hookworm populations, the lab hopes to discover more effective control measures and mitigate the spread of resistance.</p>
<h2>A Folk Remedy with Modern Potential: The Bitter Melon Discovery</h2>
<p>Another unexpected breakthrough in Dr. Hawdon's research came from a master’s student with a passion for ethnobotany, the study of traditional plant-based medicines. While conducting fieldwork in Haiti, she met a voodoo priest who shared knowledge of traditional medicinal plants used for deworming. Curious, she returned with five plant samples for lab testing, and while all showed some level of activity, one stood out: bitter melon.</p>
<p>Intrigued, Dr. Hawdon began growing bitter melon himself, harvesting and processing the plants in his own backyard to further investigate its curative properties. His lab has since uncovered that compounds within the plant disrupt feeding in specific developmental stages of hookworms and is currently working to identify the active components responsible for this effect and understand their mechanisms of action—research which may uncover novel plant-based alternatives for helminthiasis treatments.</p>
<p>The Power of Curiosity and Persistence</p>
<p>Dr. Hawdon’s journey is a testament to the idea that science rewards those who follow their curiosity, even if it means navigating unpredictable paths along the way.</p>
<p>His story demonstrates that great discoveries don't always come from carefully laid plans; sometimes they emerge from a pile of rejection letters, an exhausting job, or an unexpected conversation with a veterinarian friend. The key lies in recognizing opportunities where others see obstacles, and finding value in the unexpected.</p>
<p>After all, as Dr. Hawdon has learned firsthand, serendipity truly does favor the prepared mind.</p>

        excerpt: "For innovator Scott Sklar, renewable energy is about more than climate—it's about human survival."
        content: `<p>As geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky once said, “nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution,” but what is there to say when even the framework evolution is built on doesn't make sense? As a species, humanity has only begun to peel back the film covering the mysteries of evolution; ecological surveillance allows for the understanding of the interplay between an organism and its environment, elucidating why certain traits are selected for in nature. However, the genetic origins of such selected traits are often unknown—leaving many scientists fascinated on how changes in the genome give rise to evolutionary novelty.</p>
<p>To explore these unknowns, Dr.Luca Livraghi studies the colorful and diverse patterns on the wings of butterflies. These evolutionary canvases boast strong visual evidence of selection, making butterflies an effective system for studying how changes in the genome lead to ecological adaptation. This work in particular encapsulates multiple sub-fields of biology, stitching together population genetics—which heavily relies on statistical analyses to pinpoint regions of DNA that show high levels of variability within a given population—and evolutionary developmental genetics, which attempts to make sense of evolutionary change by uncovering the genetic mechanisms responsible for producing novel traits in a species. Dr. Livraghi, who is trained as an evolutionary biologist, currently works at George Washington University as a Postdoctoral Researcher to understand these mechanisms, peering into the world of silvered wing patterns in Speyeria mormonia butterflies.</p>
<p>Example of natural flower pollination. Closeup of common yellow-orange Mormon Fritillary butterfly (Speyeria mormonia) attracted to pink bee balm blossom.</p>
<p>"The butterfly system itself is an incredible way to measure diversity; on a phenotypic level, you have scorable natural variation within populations that is very easy to get at experimentally. Because butterflies are so variable, you can easily track phenotypically associated genetic variants and see how they change over space and time."</p>
<p>A characteristic analysis often utilized in this field is the Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). Through inputting the genetic information of groups of individuals displaying a wide range of phenotypes, the GWAS searches through the entire population’s genome, giving information on small differences, or polymorphisms, in DNA sequence between each subject. A successful GWA experiment can accurately identify a single location across DNA samples with high levels of polymorphism—meaning there are unmatching nucleotides between individuals with different phenotypes at that specific location. This data can be used to conclude that, for example, a fish with red scales has a mutation in a certain area while a fish with blue scales doesn’t, explaining their differences in morphology.</p>
<p>For Dr. Livraghi, conducting a GWAS was just the beginning of a series of comprehensive experiments to further confirm the involvement of the gene optix in the repression of silver colored scales in the wings of Speyeria mormonia, a North American orange and silver butterfly. Previously identified as a master regulator of eye development in Drosophila fruit flies, optix has been found to take on a different role in the wings of butterflies, acting as a genetic light switch for coloration and patterning (1). This epitomizes the central pillar of evolutionary development, showing how the genetic regions surrounding certain genes can become hotspots of evolutionary diversity, as slight changes in gene expression opens up an abundance of potential pathways for further evolution to tread upon.</p>
<p>To examine closer, Dr. Livraghi performed a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) experiment to target and fluorescently tag optix mRNA transcripts, visualizing their location within the tissue through a microscope. Fluorescent stainings are able to determine how and when a gene may perform its function. Results found that at ~50% pupal development, optix is absent in presumptive silvered spots on the wings, indicating it may work to repress the silver scale state.</p>
<p>“The way that optix has picked up this role in butterflies is unclear. We’re not sure what the ancestral role of this gene was, but even though it acts as a regulator of eye development in Drosophila, it doesn’t mean it was necessarily ‘co-opted’ [re-used] towards a pattern regulation gene in butterflies. In CRISPR knock-out individuals, we don’t see any effects in the eye, so the hypothesis is shaky—optix is definitely pleiotropic, it’s unclear and unlikely that it’s been co-opted from an eye development role.”</p>
<p>Dr. Livraghi worked to confirm these findings through utilization of RNA interference (RNAi) gene ‘knockdown’, which gives insight into an organism’s phenotype if it didn’t have a certain gene during crucial periods in its development. Through the introduction of a silencing RNA species into the cells of the developing pupal wing, researchers are able to target and break down RNA transcripts of a gene of interest. In this case, the knockdowns targeted the optix gene, and the resulting mutants yielded fascinating results—covering the wings with patches of silver. This data all but confirms that optix functions to suppress silvered spots; its regulation during development, amazingly, has been controlled tightly by evolution, restricting it from specific areas on the wing but allowing free reign everywhere else. The precise control of pigment genes is crucial for adaptive evolution of all butterfly species, allowing for a wide range of diversity among populations.</p>
<p>Developing and using the genetic tools we have at our disposal is crucial to examining the world around us, allowing for the gradual climb of our species towards greater understanding—unraveling the complex knots that biology has tied itself since the dawn of cellular life. Mechanistic explanations for evolutionary processes act as a flame to ignite these knots and fuel our progress, providing the basis for millions of years of evolutionary diversity.</p>
<p>"If you want to understand evolutionary principles, you have to understand the underlying genetic drivers of diversity—to understand how phenotypes evolved, first you must understand how genes evolved to generate these phenotypes. To understand the general evolutionary principle, you need to understand genetics. There’s another side to the quote ‘nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution’. In reality, nothing makes sense except in the light of development, it’s necessary to pull back the folds of such evolutionary questions."</p>

        excerpt: "Dr. Michael T. Ullman's Declarative/Procedural model links mental lexicon to declarative memory."
        content: `<p>Most people would agree that science is a serious field, as studying the inner workings of the physical and natural world demands precision and relentless inquiry. One person’s findings become the foundation of another person’s next decade of work, and if that foundation is revealed to be faulty, you’re out of luck. You can’t wing a research experiment. You can’t just be ‘pretty sure’ you added an aliquot from vial A and not accidentally from vial B. You can’t just synthesize a drug that you think might work, or calculate the amount of fuel necessary to send a spaceship to Mars and cross your fingers that it will be enough. Precision matters and the work is serious.</p>
<p>With that being said, STEM students and professionals deserve to let loose sometimes and have fun where we can. As a devout believer in the religion of Silly, I have immense appreciation for my predecessors in science who have chosen to permeate the studies of life with the wackiest of words, and I hope to share the joy that some of these words have given me with the rest of the science community. In this aim, I contacted some Georgetown University professors to inquire about their favorite wacky words, and I bring them to you here today. I hope we can all find ways to spontaneously incorporate these words into our daily lexicon; to brighten the lives of others and bask in the joy of scientific nomenclature.</p>
<p>Doctor holding human ear model to learn and treat hearing loss in patient.</p>
<p>Habenula perforata</p>
<p>Perhaps it is no coincidence that some of science’s wackiest words involve the study of the ear; the researchers of the auditory system have ensured that their studies be audibly exciting. Dr. Thomas Coate, an Associate Professor and Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies at Georgetown University’s Department of Biology, also happens to study what I’ve recently discovered to be a wacky-word treasure trove — the cochlea. This spiral-shaped, fluid-filled structure in the inner ear is unsurprisingly complicated and intricate. The cochlea is not only fascinating to study for its elaborate anatomical structure or crucial function in mediating human communication, but also for the neverending linguistic excitement it offers.</p>
<p>Upon performing a quick search for ‘labeled cochlea’ you might find yourself pleasantly surprised, as I was, to learn of the ‘scala vestibuli,’ ‘tectorial membrane,’ or ‘spiral ganglion.’ One structure that artists often neglect from these diagrams, though, which perhaps only a cochlea expert like Dr. Coate himself would be acquainted with, is the ‘habenula perforata.’ In the grand scheme of the ear, these small perforations may appear insignificant, but their importance should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>To reference the long-standing question Dr. Coate asked in my introductory Neurobiology course, “if a tree falls in an empty forest, does it make a sound?” In short, the answer is both yes and no. Sound, in its essence, is the periodic vibration of air molecules within a specific frequency range perceptible to the human brain. As such, sound waves can exist outside of human perception as vibrations of air, but the act of ‘hearing’ these oscillations requires a brain to process them. Returning to the habenula perforata, these perforations within the bony structure of the cochlea provide an opening for auditory nerve fibers to pass into the inner ear and innervate the hair cells that detect sound. If not for this seamless connection between our detection of sound as a physical sensation and the subsequent neural processing performed by our brain, we could not actually hear.</p>
<p>A detailed labeled cross-sectional diagram of the cochlea, the spiral-shaped structure in the inner ear responsible for hearing. The image highlights key components, including the bony cochlear wall, scala vestibuli, cochlear duct, tectorial membrane, basilar membrane, scala tympani, Organ of Corti, spiral ganglion, and the cochlear branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve (N VIII). These structures work together to convert sound vibrations into neural signals that are transmitted to the brain for auditory perception.</p>

<h2>Epiboly</h2>
<p>Students who have taken an introductory biology course may recognize some of the embryonic development stages, namely morula, blastula, gastrulation, and neurulation, but these fun terms, it turns out, are just the beginning. Dr. Elena Silva, a professor in the Department of Biology at Georgetown University, studies neurodevelopment in the frog Xenopus laevis and the acorn worm Saccoglossus kowalevski (yes, full names included on purpose ;)). One of her favorite words in development, epiboly (pronounced epíbolee), describes the process of cell division, flattening, and expansion that occurs during the embryonic stage of gastrulation in order to enclose the embryo with a layer of cells called surface ectoderm. The surface ectoderm eventually gives rise to epidermis (the outer layer of skin), hair and nails, inner ear structures (perhaps including the habenula perforata?) and more. Epiboly is a highly important process that enables humans to develop the right structures in the right places at the right time.</p>

<h2>Tribbles</h2>
<p>Although many terms receive their wackiness from the way they sound, a few scientists have actively sought to imbue their work with fun concepts from outside the science world. You may have heard about Sonic Hedgehog — the signaling molecule involved in the development of the central nervous system — but have you heard about Tribbles? To quote Professor Mun Chun Chan of Georgetown University’s Department of Biology, these creatures, which originate from the original Star Trek series, “are cute balls of fur that squeak, and everyone loves them… except Klingons.” Although Tribbles only used to only belong to the world of science fiction, when researchers Jörg Großhans and Eric Wieschaus discovered that a genetic mutation caused fly larvae to develop into furballs in May, 2000, they aptly named the corresponding protein after the Star Trek species. For further amusement, later papers studying this protein continued to reference its Star Trek origins, with several papers titled after the episode in which they first appeared: “The Trouble with Tribbles” (Season 2, Episode 15 if you’re interested).</p>
<h2>Norbornane</h2>
<p>Although the previous three words were gracious contributions from my professors, I couldn’t end without paying my respects to a personal favorite of mine. In addition to admiring some biology-related words, I wanted to shed light on the wackiness that exists in what many find to be a highly intimidating field — organic chemistry.</p>
<p>While taking Organic Chemistry I, one word struck me particularly. It struck my exam performance as well, which, to tell you the truth, is how I first encountered the molecule ‘norbornane.’ If you’re familiar with the Phineas and Ferb meme in which Doofenshmirtz says “if I had a nickel for every time [insert event], I’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice,” you’ll understand my sentiment when after exam two, I was again deducted points for a problem pertaining to a seven-carbon bicyclic structure. Determined to never again let this carbon species defeat me, I went on a Google hunt for ‘hexene ring bridged bicyclic structure triangle,’ and was so delighted to discover the name of my nemesis — norbornane — that I named my plant after it. When my plant later died (unintentionally, of course), I grieved, but also took it as a sign that I had finally conquered my foe. Norbornane is used in various synthetic processes, and to those who have not yet taken organic chemistry, it is also commonly used by professors to trick students on stereochemistry-related problems. So beware!</p>

<p>Example Ways to Incorporate These Words Into Your Daily Language:</p>
<p>These words may seem niche and irrelevant to your daily life, but I urge you to consider a different perspective. Oftentimes in my science lectures, the contrast between minute two, in which the professor is introducing the "key points" of the day's lecture, and minute 38, in which we are knee-deep into the study of a reaction pathway or biological process, can be extremely discouraging. It is in those moments, though, after moving past the surface-level material and truly entering the intricacies of life’s mechanisms, that we can really see its beauties, both metaphorically and literally. The four words I’ve highlighted may not be part of your everyday language, but they represent individual concepts that took years of research and inquiry to discover, and if you are open to learning about them, they’re right at your fingertips.</p>
<p>Besides my love for learning wacky words, I truly enjoy finding creative ways to incorporate them into my daily language. The following are some hypothetical situations that I have contrived to help demonstrate how you can do the same.</p>
<p>“Are you even listening to me? It’s like words are going in one ear and coming out the other. Do you lack a habenula perforata?”</p>
<p>“I was so confused by today’s lecture! The professor was speaking but that information definitely did not reach my habenula perforata because I have no idea what she said.”</p>
<p>“Wow, I have so much work to do— I’m so all over the place I feel like I’m undergoing epiboly!”</p>
<p>“I’m so excited to finish college, pursue my career, and reach my fate! I’m like a developing embryonic cell— I’m undergoing epiboly, and I’m just about to reach my destination and discover my potential!”</p>
<p>“It’s so cold outside! Someone CRISPR a Tribbles mutation into me because I would really like to become a ball of fur!”</p>
<p>For Norbornane, I don’t have any great examples, but I can confidently say from experience that it makes an excellent plant name. I could see it being used for a fish, as well.</p>

        excerpt: "We sat down with Holden Thorp to explore how one of the world's leading science journals navigates communication."
        content: `<p>From vibrant butterfly wings to subtle fruit fly patterns, insect coloration isn't just nature’s canvas—it’s evolution at play. Delving into genetics reveals that tiny regulatory tweaks in gene expression can trigger massive shifts, influencing everything from camouflage and mimicry to courtship behaviors. By understanding these molecular mechanisms, scientists unravel not only how insects communicate visually but also how evolution endlessly crafts complexity and diversity from genetic simplicity.</p>
<p>Postman butterfly (Heliconius melpomene) with open wings displaying red, black, and white patterns, perched on a purple flower against a blurred green background.</p>
<p>Heliconius Melpomene, the Postman Butterfly - a likely hybrid between melpomene subspecies malleti and plesseni (by Miroslav Srb, licensed for educational use via Adobe Stock). The most captivating aspect of insects, looking past their naturally uncharismatic morphologies, is the diversity of pigmentation and patterning they can display; this field of study within insect biology spans over a breadth of sub-disciplines, including development, biochemistry, biophysics, genetics, evolution, and ecology. Its significance as an evolutionary trait is undeniable, playing roles in intra- and interspecific communication patterns, mimicry and camouflage, as well as physiological and biochemical processes [1]. While the functional importance behind the evolution of coloration is well characterized, what we often don’t understand is the basis of coloration on a molecular level. Insects, as a class, boast an astounding diversity of color patterns, ranging from 300 to 700 nm wavelengths—reaching outside the spectrum of visible light for mammals [2].</p>
<p>Modern research has only scratched the surface in uncovering the genes responsible for generating this variability between insect species; beginning to understand the developmental role that a gene may play tells us only a fraction of the picture, as these functions are not set in evolutionary “stone.” For example, yellow, a gene known to produce melanin pigment, is ubiquitously expressed throughout the wings and wing veins of fruit flies to produce patterns necessary for communication [3]. While various homologues—genes inherited from common ancestry—of yellow are known to code for similar functions, slight tuning of its spatial and temporal expression can give rise to not only an incredible number of novel phenotypes and patterns but completely new functions as well. How a particular protein or RNA interacts with its surrounding cellular environment is of utmost importance in determining its function [4]. To put this into perspective, yellow can take on an additional role, as it is necessary for male courtship behavior in several fruit fly species. Behavioral assays have determined that the presence of these melanic wing spots is an agent of sexual selection—tying yellow to not only producing secondary sexual characteristics from a morphological standpoint but doubling down on sexual selection through mediating physiological and neuronal processes, ultimately affecting behavior to increase direct fitness [5]. Interestingly, this goes both ways; the yellow orthologue (the same yellow gene passed down from common ancestry, granted with some small changes between species) in Bicyclus butterflies acts to repress male courtship behavior, displaying the volatility of small evolutionary tuning of gene expression. Here we see selection acting two ways on a single gene; it’s not uncommon that we find genes responsible for producing a visual signal also encode either positive or negative behavioral preference for such signals [6]. Visual signals are essential for communication, and with an expanded toolkit of diverse chemical pigments, insects are the most interesting system to study these visual signals.</p>
<p>Despite the wide range of possibilities, nature finds ways to reuse especially useful patterns and colors for certain signals or signaling systems. To give an example, we can look to the evolution of mimicry, a strategy used often by various insect species. Mimicry describes how those of different species begin to evolve similar, or ‘mimicked,’ phenotypes as a way to amplify a signal—as some are especially valuable to many insect species. Aposematic coloration, a warning signal to predators to alert them of toxicity (or just of bad taste), holds much value as a phenotype to mimic. Many species take up similar signals like these, not because they think it's pretty, but because an evolutionary force selecting for these traits pushes species towards congruence with these patterns and colors—all driven by maximizing fitness, the success rate at which genes are passed onto the next generation.</p>

Limenitis archippus (Viceroy, Left) Danaus plexippus (Monarch, Right)</p>
<p>What has been more elusive to our understanding, however, isn’t why these phenomena evolve—but how. Recent research suggests that certain natural instances of pattern mimicry can be explained by a single master regulator gene; optix, a homeobox (a family of proteins, all of which include a characteristic ‘homeobox’ domain) transcription factor, is responsible for the phenotypic expression of red patterning in Heliconius butterflies [7]. What makes this case stand out is the repeated evolution of optix in multiple different species to give rise to a seemingly infinite number of patterns and variations.</p>

Heliconius erato amazonia (Red Postman, Left) and Heliconius melpomene melpomene  (Postman, Right)</p>
<p>This isn’t as simple as directly mutating the gene sequence repeatedly—no, that’s much too random and deleterious to consistently act as a driving force for evolution. The most common form of molecular and developmental change in evolution comes from regulatory tweaks. Similar to yellow, nature can twist parameters on where, when, and how these genes are expressed, all through changes in cis-regulatory expression. Cis-regulatory elements include enhancer and repressor regions in DNA—where important transcription factors bind in order to activate or hinder gene expression (the process of turning DNA sequences into RNA, and ultimately [but not always] protein). As mentioned, these cis-regulatory elements truly control every advanced direction for a gene during development [8]. Variations in DNA sequence, transcription factor or cofactor accessibility, and epigenetic modifications are all examples of factors that influence enhancer or repressor activity. These changes, in turn, regulate the expression of genes like optix, determining its activation in specific scale types or regions of the butterfly wing. Similar to yellow, evolution has a way of shifting not just parameters, but function, as a result. While the optix gene sequence remains the same in other butterfly & moth species, it has been shown to be absent in the production of red pigment. Understanding the mechanisms behind the gain and loss of regulatory specifications is a compelling way to study evolution, and researchers are only beginning to pull back the film in this field.</p>

        excerpt: "Dr. Song Gao bridges science and policy to tackle climate change, ozone depletion, and environmental sustainability."
        content: `<p>Tyler Wyka (GWU SEAS BS ‘24, MS ‘25) stands at the crossroads of engineering, sustainability, and global change. As a Mechanical Engineering graduate student at George Washington University, his work spans the technical frontiers of decarbonizing energy systems while fostering international collaborations that address the pressing challenges of climate change. From his research in the Leblanc Laboratory — where he models the performance of alternative fuels in aero-derivative gas turbines — to his hands-on efforts helping communities build climate-resilient infrastructure in Sierra Leone, Wyka embodies the modern engineer: a connector of disciplines, a catalyst for innovation, and an advocate for pragmatic change. His journey, shaped by curiosity, collaboration, and a commitment to impact, continues to inspire a new generation of engineers to embrace a broader responsibility—not just to advance technology, but to create a future worth building.</p>
<h2>Introduction: Pioneering Sustainable Innovation</h2>
<p>Tyler Wyka is a current first-year Mechanical Engineering graduate student at the George Washington University School of Engineering & Applied Science (SEAS), whose work explores the potential application of alternative energy technologies in the development of new sustainable practices. Outside of the Leblanc Laboratory, Wyka additionally works directly with organizations like the Association for Energy Engineers and the Advanced Energy Group to drive a culture-oriented change in how we think about the sustainable transition. His belief in pragmatic change does not stop at GW, he said, as he also works directly with international partners in Sierra Leone and is looking to expand global collaboration to support communities of all kinds.</p>
<p>“The US has benefited from an age of prosperity using fossil fuels to build our country… There are countries around the world not as fortunate. It feels right that we should do what we can to help.”</p>
<p>Wyka exemplifies the qualities of a modern engineer, blending technical expertise with a broader understanding of policy and sustainability. Wyka’s story also represents the values of child-like wonder that every scientist can unlock inside themselves. And above all, he wears a smile every single day.</p>
<h2>The Big Bang</h2>
<p>On paper, Sierra Leone and New Jersey have almost nothing in common. However, Tyler Wyka eventually found himself working in both, helping to bring change from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Growing up in a small town in New Jersey as the son of a politician and an activist, Wyka often attended his father’s speeches on political reform and Garden State equality marches organized by his mother. There, Wyka developed his sensibility for the wider political world and the importance of upholding his two most defining traits to this day: curiosity and collaboration.</p>
<p>“[My parents] instilled in me a core value to never accept the status quo if you have the power to do something,” Wyka said.</p>
<p>His curiosity was not far behind. As a young teenager, Wyka’s favorite activities involved watching science documentaries and reading, usually focusing on space exploration or the cosmos. At age 13, Wyka attended a viewing of a Hubble Space Telescope documentary at the Jersey City Liberty Science Center. Amazed at the starry imagery and the vast depths of the universe, Wyka felt a newfound gratitude for the Earth’s existence in the cosmos, he said, and left the theater inspired.</p>
<p>“I walked out of that big IMAX dome a changed person, in awe of my place in the Universe,” Wyka said.</p>
<p>Being both curious about the cosmos and Congress, it was a no-brainer for Wyka to attend GWU to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, allowing him to pursue both his dreams of achieving political change and technological advancements, he said.</p>
<h2>The Catalyst</h2>
<p>During his second year of undergraduate study, Wyka joined the Design Build Fly Team, a club dedicated to constructing aircraft and attending national design competitions to showcase talented engineers. Through his experience constructing wings and analyzing flight patterns, Wyka began to envision his future at a company like NASA or SpaceX, he said, where he could achieve his lifelong dream of helping humanity reach beyond the stars. Somewhere along the way, however, he had an epiphany—one that would alter his trajectory. He realized that while the cosmos may be a vast and untapped domain, the true miracle wasn’t beyond the atmosphere; it was here, on Earth. The planet itself, a delicate and improbable oasis in the cold expanse of the universe, would be a much more rewarding problem to work on, he said.</p>
<p>“It really is a beautiful science,” Wyka said. “Working on the environment is a much more interdisciplinary project. It’s not just the technology, but the communication and acceptance of that technology.”</p>
<p>With this new sense of purpose, Wyka immersed himself in sustainability research at GW. He joined the Leblanc Laboratory in 2021, where he worked on energy systems optimization research. But he didn’t stop there—science alone wouldn’t help the world’s problems. To drive meaningful change, it was essential to align policy, industry, and public perception. He took his knowledge beyond the lab, working with the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) to influence how institutions and industries approached energy transitions. From 2023 to 2024, Wyka helped lead a team of multidisciplinary students to compete in the Solar District Cup national competition hosted by NREL. The competition focused on developing a three-part plan that included policy, finance, and design, demonstrating the integrative nature of climate work.</p>
<p>However, Wyka’s understanding of the interconnectedness of the modern world urged him to seek out collaborative opportunities outside the United States. He contacted and began a relationship with the Forum for Agriculture, Innovation and Empowerment for Children and Youth in Sierra Leone (FAIECY-SL) to learn about the struggles of those most impacted by the global climate crisis and how to help. FAIECY-SL, founded in 2020, is a youth-led organization working on climate resilience infrastructure and ecological innovation. After winning a grant from the Charitable Foundation of the Energy Bar Association (CFEBA) — a D.C.-based NGO focused on energy-related projects — Wyka and FAIECY-SL joined forces to construct solar drying huts in rural communities of Sierra Leone, allowing communities to effectively preserve their harvests.</p>
<p>A lively community gathering in an African village features a traditional cultural performance. A masked and costumed performer covered in raffia stands in the center, surrounded by a diverse crowd of onlookers, including local residents and international visitors. Some individuals wear green vests labeled "FAIECY - SL," and one person wears a shirt labeled "VANDENBERG." The setting includes traditional mud huts and a few modern buildings in the background. The atmosphere appears festive and engaging</p>
<p>Throughout his undergraduate experience, Wyka’s interests led him down many diverse paths, often not lining up with the cookie-cutter idea of an “engineer.” However, these experiences across a diverse set of passions helped Wyka grow into a successful connector of ideas and a catalyst for change. As the 2024 recipient of the GW Engineering Dean’s Alumni prize, the GW SEAS selected Wyka to speak at commencement at the end of his undergraduate career, inspiring a new generation of engineers to embrace the broader responsibilities of both innovation and advocacy for a future worth building.</p>
<h2>A Sustainable Now!</h2>
<p>Now, as a graduate student, Wyka’s research tackles one of the most pressing challenges in sustainability: decarbonizing energy systems. His work focuses on aero-derivative gas turbines, compact and high-energy systems often used in ships, and on ascertaining how alternative fuels can impact gas turbine efficiency and reduce emissions from the United States Navy.</p>
<p>By utilizing Python to create computer models, Wyka simulates the real-world performance of turbines operating on hydrogen and methanol-blended fuels, then compares them to traditional diesel. He incorporates Cantera, an open-source combustion simulation tool, to analyze fuel consumption, power output, and emissions. By validating his model against Arleigh Burke-class destroyers — DEFINITION —, he bridges the gap between theory and practice, ensuring that his research has real-world applications, he said.</p>

<p>Wyka’s findings will support decarbonization research for the broader marine transport sector, which, if it were a country, falls directly behind China, the U.S., India, the E.U., and Russia in its production of greenhouse gas emissions. If these alternative fuels prove viable, they could accelerate the maritime industry’s transition to cleaner energy sources. Overall, climate research can affect numerous areas and necessitates a broad synthesis of engineering expertise, a commitment to sustainability, and an ability to apply cutting-edge technology to real-world problems. Wyka exemplifies how working on climate change is not a simple fix, but rather a complex web of interconnected issues in almost every field of study.</p>
<p>Tyler Wyka, at his core, is committed to advancing sustainable energy solutions in an ever-changing world. Given the complex nature of international climate change, Wyka’s work spans both local efforts in sustainable energy and international efforts in agricultural security. As he continues his graduate studies, Wyka remains a devoted individual who is quick to highlight that his path was “always forward, never straight,” he said.</p>
<p>“I think it’s beautiful we’re given the chance to live, breathe, think, and feel. I want my work to reflect that, be a part of the solutions for a more sustainable future.”</p>

        excerpt: "Tyler Wyka bridges engineering, sustainability, and global collaboration to drive real-world solutions."
        content: `<p>Dr. Song Gao of Georgetown University reveals how bridging atmospheric chemistry and environmental policy can drive real-world sustainability. In this article, Gao discusses his transformative journey from synthetic chemistry to investigating the impacts of aerosols on climate change and the ozone layer. Drawing on lessons from the Montreal Protocol and its innovative integration of science with policy, he highlights the critical need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Gao’s insights underscore that only by aligning scientific breakthroughs with pragmatic, flexible policies can we effectively combat the escalating challenges of global environmental degradation.</p>

<p>Forest Fire, Wildfire burning tree in red and orange color. Photo by yelantsevv From fires and floods to unprecedented scalding temperatures in worldwide locations, global climate change is becoming an increasingly pressing issue. The scientific community must find ways to address it. Despite the already-palpable implications, factors such as technological advances, convenience, and political motives all impede on the ability to mitigate the accumulating damage to the environment. While societal change can be idealized at the individual level, the urgency of global climate change demands pragmatic initiative and creativity to implement structural changes.</p>
<p>In recent years, Professor Song Gao from Georgetown University’s Department of Chemistry has worked to battle environmental systems’ damage and promote sustainability on a broader scale: international policy.</p>
<p>From Synthetic Chemistry to Atmospheric Chemistry</p>
<p>Throughout his undergraduate studies, Dr. Gao was primarily focused on synthetic chemistry. With a long-held passion for the environment, though, he pursued polymer synthesis, seeking to develop cleaner materials for energy storage. When he began his search for a graduate program, though, his interests drew him to PhD advisors at the University of Washington, and later his postdoctoral mentors at Caltech, to work on broader environmental science issues — in particular, atmospheric chemistry. There, Dr. Gao began researching the effects of aerosols on air pollution and the climate. While scientists had understood some of their harmful effects on air quality, they were just beginning to decipher the climate impacts of organic aerosols, especially, in both reflecting sunlight (a direct impact) and influencing the formation of clouds (an indirect impact).</p>
<p>The Montreal Protocol and Policy Influence</p>
<p>While Dr. Gao’s focus on air pollution and climate change has remained strong, a pivotal encounter in 2016 inspired him to consider incorporating a new angle to his work. A group of science-based policy makers asked Dr. Gao to write a review article on stratospheric ozone depletion and its implications on the regulation of chlorofluorocarbons, better known as CFCs. These molecules, which have been widely used as refrigerants, coolants and fire extinguishers since the 1940s, were discovered to play a massive role in the destruction of the ozone layer in the 1970s — a finding so consequential that it won Crutzen, Molina, and Rowland, the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Due to their stable C-F and C-Cl bonds, CFCs are mostly inert in the lower atmosphere and resistant to degradation efforts. Upon traveling to the upper atmosphere, however, the sun’s ultraviolet radiation breaks these covalent bonds. The resulting Cl and Br radicals deplete the earth’s ozone layer, inhibiting its function of filtering the most cancerous and dangerous wavelengths of ultraviolet light from reaching biological life on earth’s surface.</p>
<p>The Rowland-Molina theory of ozone depletion.</p>
<p>As awareness of their harm grew, the United Nations signed the Montreal Protocol in 1987 to phase out the use of CFCs. Often considered the UN’s most successful international agreement, the Montreal Protocol has eliminated approximately 99% of ozone-depleting substances in the environment.</p>
<p>Following that initial collaboration with science policymakers, Dr. Gao became aware of the massive potential for widespread influence by incorporating clever policy into scientific work.</p>
<p>“I realized that for science to truly improve society and safeguard the environment, it must interface with policy effectively,” he said. “That realization has influenced my approach ever since.”</p>
<p>Although rooted in science, environmental policy — as with everything related to government affairs — is strongly influenced by politics. In Chemical Transformations in the Environment, a course Dr. Gao teaches at Georgetown, he highlights “the three Ps” that underlie effective environmental policy: people, planet, and profit.</p>
<p>“If one aspect is ignored, the entire system becomes unworkable. If policies or solutions negatively impact people’s livelihoods or cause economic losses, they won’t be accepted. If, however, the focus is solely on profits and politics while polluting the environment, that’s unsustainable. And if we protect the environment but ignore economic or social factors, the approach is too naïve to be effective,” he said. “Sustainability requires integrating all three.”</p>
<p>The ingenious approach of the Montreal Protocol, according to Dr. Gao, was its unprecedented flexibility and consideration for the “three Ps.” Since its initial ratification, it has been amended more than 20 times to incorporate new scientific findings and the differing on-the-ground realities that various countries face. Other international agreements like the Paris Agreement, which demanded rigid, often-quantified commitments, and imposed higher economic costs, have shown much less success.</p>
<h2>Current Work</h2>
<p>A large industrial smokestack emitting thick white gas or steam into a clear blue sky, symbolizing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution.</p>
<p>Nitrous oxide emissions from wastewater treatment systems. Although highly successful at eliminating ozone depletion, the Montreal Protocol showed an unexpected outcome. While the ozone layer was showing signs of replenishment, some of the replacements for CFCs — particular HFCs and HCFCs — posed a separate issue: climate warming. In light of this discovery, 163 parties signed the 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, agreeing to phase out HFCs as well.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, however, air quality data from recent years has shown increasing concentrations of certain CFCs and HFCs in the environment pointing to undisclosed, potentially illicit use. Continued emissions of these substances seriously hinder the ongoing efforts to combat climate change and ozone depletion. Consequently, in 2021, Dr. Gao took action and partnered with Dr. Stephen Anderson — one of the founders of the famous Montreal Protocol and a prominent figure in environmental policy — on a highly influential paper addressing this issue.</p>
<p>Through extensive research, Dr. Gao and his collaborators revealed a potential loophole in the Protocol that allows exemptions of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) for “critical uses” in medicine, manufacturing, and other applications. Growing evidence indicates misuse and overuse of these exemptions for non-critical purposes, which also may include plastics production. In their work, Dr. Gao and Dr. Anderson identified multiple pathways by which some ODSs and HFCs may be converted into fluoropolymers, like Teflon. In their paper they offer actionable recommendations for further amending the Montreal Protocol in order to more effectively prevent exploitation of its exemptions and to maximize its success at battling multiple and inter-linking environmental damages.</p>
<h2>Bringing Science into Action: The Role of Policy in Environmental Research</h2>
<p>Dr. Gao’s work highlights a key but often overlooked application for science-oriented work. Although most discoveries are made in the lab, there is vast potential for wider influence through interdisciplinary work. There exists a problematic gap in science communication that limits the accessibility of breakthrough research to people outside the field, and prevents widespread implementation of crucial scientific developments.</p>
<p>“Understanding policy has influenced the kinds of scientific questions I pursue. If you want your research to have real-world impacts, it’s important to study science that is relevant to policy and societal needs,” Dr. Gao said.</p>
<h2>Takeaways For Students</h2>
<p>To the readers here, at the heart of the nation’s capital, consider Dr. Gao’s message:</p>
<p>“Right now, science and policy are not as integrated as they should be. Scientists and policymakers are often curious about each other’s fields, but there aren’t many structured pathways for collaboration,” he said. “That’s why I encourage students to study both. A strong foundation in chemistry, ecology, mathematics and atmospheric science is essential. But it’s equally important to develop skills in scientific communication and environmental policy. Having expertise in both allows for an effective convergence of the two.”</p>
<p>As is made clearer every day, the worsening condition of the environment demands scientific minds to collaborate towards discovering innovative solutions, and often tweak existing solutions. While climate change is an undoubtedly urgent issue, environmental science is one of many fields in STEM that can benefit from interdisciplinary collaboration and communication. This field allows for a positive impact on the world through science and a wide scope of influence, even if the means are unconventional.</p>

        excerpt: "Dr. Luca Livraghi studies the colorful patterns on butterfly wings to understand evolutionary novelty."
        content: `<p>Science relies on models. These systems quantify, predict, and explain phenomena. Models undergo optimization, peer review, and rigorous testing. Yet, sometimes they falter. When they stumble, contradictions emerge.</p>
<p>Scientific paradoxes highlight the limits of our thinking. They reveal assumptions mistaken for truths. What seems like model failure prompts us to rethink our foundational beliefs. We must redefine the premises that guide scientific understanding.</p>
<p>A person in a suit holds an impossible geometric figure known as the Penrose Cube, an optical illusion that defies conventional three-dimensional geometry.</p>
<p>Penrose Cube: A mind-bending illusion that twists geometry and perspective. By fran_kie.</p>
<p>Here are three paradoxes that challenge models across scientific fields. These occur in molecular biology, immunology, and neuroscience. They serve as reminders that science is an evolving process, constantly refining itself.</p>
<h2>Premonition in the Pancreas: Biology Plays the Long Game</h2>
<p>The pancreas houses alpha and beta cells that regulate blood glucose. They utilize a negative feedback loop. Beta cells release insulin to lower glucose levels. Conversely, alpha cells release glucagon to raise levels. These are biochemical opposites, yet their behavior defies simple models.</p>
<p>Beta cells suppress alpha cells through local signals, even before significant glucose changes. Similarly, alpha cells prepare glucagon release ahead of hypoglycemia. Here, we observe anticipatory regulation. Feedback occurs due to inferred trends instead of real-time inputs.</p>
<p>Mechanically, anticipation results from tight intercellular signaling and electrical coupling. Somatostatin from delta cells plays a role as well. However, this process challenges basic control theory. Traditionally, feedback loops follow a strict order: stimulus, response, and correction.</p>
<p>This predictive behavior echoes throughout biology. Neurons often fire in anticipation of sensory stimuli. Immune systems prepare against pathogens not yet encountered. Even artificial systems, like machine learning models, start recognizing patterns early. Cells don’t think independently. However, evolution has optimized their networks to mimic such behavior.</p>
<h2>Schrödinger’s Lab: No Such Thing as a Truly Isolated System</h2>
<p>You've gone to great lengths: controlled variables, sterilized surfaces, and maintained a clean setup. Yet, unexpected outcomes still occur. A cell might misbehave, a material could react unexpectedly, or a measurement may drift. The anomaly lies in assuming that the system was neutral.</p>
<p>In synthetic biology, cells often behave unpredictably, even in controlled settings. In physics, inert materials may catalyze reactions. In behavioral science, identical animals exhibit diverse actions despite identical environments. Here, context becomes a vital part of the signal we're aimed to measure.</p>
<p>Enter Schrödinger’s cat, a thought experiment in quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger envisioned a cat sealed in a box with a radioactive atom and a mechanism to kill the cat if the atom decayed. Until the box is opened, the atom exists in a superposition of states—dead and alive.</p>
<p>A stylized illustration of Schrödinger’s Cat thought experiment shows a cat inside a box with a vial of poison marked with a skull, a radioactive symbol, and a Geiger counter setup. The scene represents the quantum physics paradox.</p>
<p>Illustration of Schrödinger’s Cat Thought Experiment. By Oleksander Hokusai</p>
<p>Schrödinger intended to illustrate the absurdity of scaling quantum principles to everyday objects. The core insight remains: in quantum systems, observation is not passive. Measurement influences a system's state.</p>
<p>At the quantum level, measurement collapses a probabilistic framework into a definite outcome. The implications extend beyond quantum mechanics. In experimental science, the notion that we can observe without effecting change is often aspirational.</p>
<p>While I’m not suggesting your cells will thrive if you sing to them, it's essential to recognize that labs aren't neutral spaces. Instruments carry biases, and observation inherently shapes results. Scientists must face the reality that observation is part of the experimental process.</p>
<p>When the Output is Right but the Wiring is a Mystery</p>
<p>Imagine a machine-learning model trained on incomplete data. It still predicts outcomes with surprising accuracy. Consider climate models that align with observations despite omitted variables. In genomics, partial sequences can yield reliable predictions of complex traits. Here, the outputs are accurate, yet the mechanisms remain mysterious.</p>
<p>This paradox of overperforming systems highlights a significant challenge. Tools can deliver valid results even when functioning outside our understanding. Statistically, one might interpret this as overfitting—a model memorizing quirks in data but failing to generalize. Surprisingly, many systems, particularly in machine learning, indeed generalize well.</p>
<p>Deep learning, for example, often uncovers patterns beyond human intuition. In biology, complex traits arise from vast networks of genes. Regulatory factors further complicate causality, yet predictive models often deliver quality results.</p>
<p>A glossy black cube is pierced by a series of twisting, metallic wires, floating in a minimalist, softly lit environment. The cube casts a shadow below, and the wires create an abstract, dynamic form around it.</p>
<h2>The Black Box: Where data goes in, but mystery comes out. By Tameem</h2>
<p>Such challenges raise important epistemological questions. In high-stakes fields like medicine, where AI is becoming prevalent, understanding a model's output process is critical. When a system yields unexplainable results, it becomes a black box. The risk lies in mistaking the model for reality.</p>
<h2>Why Paradox Matters</h2>
<p>Paradoxes signify that science isn't broken. They illuminate instances where models don't align with observations. They surface when data surpasses interpretation and systems act unpredictably.</p>
<p>At the intersection of science and policy, paradoxes serve as invitations. They prompt re-examination of assumptions, refinement of frameworks, and the formulation of better questions.</p>
<p>So, when data misbehaves or variables refuse to remain independent, don't be quick to declare failure. It may not be the system that’s malfunctioning. Instead, it could be your perspective that requires adjustment.</p>
<p>Understanding these complexities opens pathways for deeper comprehension. Paradoxes push science forward, demanding we adapt and expand our models. For anyone eager to explore further, consider the phrase anticipatory regulation which perfectly illustrates this concept.</p>

        content: `<p>In an era of growing skepticism and polarized discourse, clear science communication is more vital than ever. We sat down with Holden Thorp to explore how one of the world’s leading science journals navigates this challenge. Join us as he reflects on his journey and the evolving role of scientific storytelling.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In a time where trust in science is eroding and public discourse grows more polarized, accurately and effectively communicating new discoveries is becoming increasingly important for progress. Science communication is not only essential to spread information in a way that excites and informs people on the world around us, but to maintain a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and innovative scientific environment. Holden Thorp, the editor-in-chief of Science Magazine, has taken on the role to mediate the efflux of such discovery, giving him a unique perspective on how science and related communication can be approached. Career trajectories can evolve unexpectedly—rather than following an idealized course, Dr. Thorp notes that he "didn't set out to be an editor in chief at Science." His career has spanned academia and leadership: first, as a laboratory researcher and associate professor at North Carolina State University; later, as Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and today, as both a professor at George Washington University and head of one of the highest impact science journals in the world.</p>
<p>Holden Thorp speaking into a handheld microphone at an indoor event, wearing black-rimmed glasses, a blue windowpane blazer, light blue shirt, and multicolored tie.</p>
<p>Holden Thorp, editor-in-chief of Science magazine</p>
<h2>The Communication Conundrum</h2>
<p>A predisposition towards communication that is commonly held within the scientific community is that those who communicate science must also be experts in the laboratory. The traditional academic hierarchy often privileges research credentials over communicative abilities, an ideology that—as the United States continues to embrace anti-intellectualism—must be challenged. Thorp addresses this as a fatal flaw for science communicative efforts today:</p>
<p>“Why does a great explainer need a pipette? If someone is good at explaining things to people, asking questions, understanding how science affects their lives—we need them to be doing all of those things, whether they’re also good in the laboratory or not.”</p>
<p>Constructing restrictions to how scientific knowledge can circulate only succeeds in gatekeeping necessary paths that the public would otherwise take advantage of. Science communication, as a whole, exists not as a way to educate the general public on certain scientific topics—it is expressed as a way to excite and get people engaged in science; Thorp emphasizes that the path of treating science communication merely a vector for educational purposes has its faults:</p>
<p>"Why should people learn science if they have a lot of other things to do? It would make for better citizens—but we’d have better citizens if people learned a lot of things, not just science."</p>
<p>Bridging the Publication Gap</p>
<p>To move forward, it's incredibly important to maintain the flow of information through engagement with platforms that expand science communication. Broader access to science is achieved through publishers such as Science, PNAS, Cell, and more. The role that these publishers play has never been to serve as mass communicators to the general public; instead, they were built to validate, archive, and advance scientific discovery, taking on immense responsibility to facilitate communication between researchers.</p>
<p>"It’s important when you talk about science communication to understand what Science’s role is. We are not in the business of communicating science to the general public—we are a publication for scientists."</p>
<p>As the demands for transparency, accessibility, and public engagement with science have grown, this traditional model has revealed its limitations, raising urgent questions about how the scientific enterprise can and should interact with the wider world. Thorp makes an important distinction: scientific journals exist primarily to facilitate communication between researchers, not to popularize findings for a lay audience. It's a necessary role, but not a complete solution to the communication gap.</p>
<p>DC's Role in the Future</p>
<p>The solution to help solidify an integral role for science communicators in the coming years stems from Washington DC, the center of discourse for the attack on higher education—as well as the center for the world’s most prestigious institutes and facilities including the NIH, National Academy of Sciences, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and more.</p>
<p>“DC has always been a center for science, it’s where most of the scientific societies are located, including mine. It’s where the NIH and many other national labs are, including several excellent research universities and hospitals—when you put all those things together, it’s one of the places that (is really great for science). It’s exciting.</p>
<p>The responsibility to bridge this gap doesn't fall only to journalists, doctors, or research specialists; it belongs to all those engaged with science. At institutions like Planet Forward, the D.C. Science Writers Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), students and professionals alike are already working to bring science out of the ivory tower and into everyday conversations. These organizations are shaping the future of scientific communication.</p>
<p>A Call to Action</p>
<p>As Thorp continues to advocate for scientific engagement, we are reminded that all of us have a part to play as members of the scientific community. Whether you're a student passionate about climate change, a researcher with a story to tell, or simply curious about how science affects your world, now is the time to step in. Participate, write, speak, and amplify. Science needs your voice.</p>

        excerpt: "Dr. Brent Harris's work in neuropathology, ALS research, and advocacy helps countless lives."
        content: `<p>Michael T. Ullman, Ph.D., is a professor in the Department of Neuroscience at Georgetown University and director of the Brain and Language Lab. This lab researches the neurocognitive bases of language and memory. While earning his doctorate in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the early 1990s, Dr. Ullman proposed the declarative/procedural (DP) model. This theoretical framework provides key insights into the neural bases of language learning and use. His work is widely cited and has applications in studying the neurocognition of language, memory, and other cognitive domains.</p>
<h2>Dr. Ullman’s Path: The Road to Neuroscience</h2>
<p>Dr. Ullman's interest in science has deep roots, stemming from his childhood. “When I was a kid, I was always interested in nature and science. My best friend’s father in San Francisco was an early geneticist. I thought, ‘Oh, genetics would be cool,’” he shared. He initially majored in biochemistry at Harvard. However, he later realized that working in a lab with Petri dishes wasn't his passion.</p>
<p>After his sophomore year, he took a four-year break from school. He helped start up a computer company and traveled internationally. When he returned to Harvard, Dr. Ullman switched his major to computer science, focusing on cognitive science and language. He hoped to use this knowledge to launch another company, this time in machine translation.</p>
<p>As Dr. Ullman delved deeper into science, he decided to pursue a Ph.D. at MIT. There, he studied language under the mentorship of Dr. Steven Pinker, a renowned psychologist in psycholinguistics. Although he appreciated his mentor’s cognitive approach to language, Dr. Ullman was intrigued by the neurobiological mechanisms behind it. With guidance from Dr. Pinker and Dr. Suzanne Corkin, he began studying patients with neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. These disorders primarily impaired different brain regions, offering a unique window into how language is processed neurologically. During this research, he developed the DP model.</p>
<h2>Foundations of Memory: Declarative and Procedural Systems</h2>
<p>To understand the DP model, it is necessary to explore the two types of memory fundamental to the human (and animal) brain. Psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists categorize learning and memory into two main types: declarative memory and procedural memory.</p>
<h2>Declarative Memory</h2>
<p>Declarative memory involves conscious recall of information, including facts and personally experienced events. An example of this is knowing historical dates or recalling details from a vacation. Essentially, it's remembering things that can be verbally expressed.</p>
<h2>Procedural Memory</h2>
<p>On the other hand, procedural memory supports non-conscious learning and retrieval of skills and habits. This type of memory involves actions like riding a bike or typing without looking at the keyboard. It is the "knowing how" aspect of memory.</p>
<p>Researchers have found that these two memory systems operate in distinct brain regions. Declarative memory primarily involves structures in the medial temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus. In contrast, procedural memory largely involves the basal ganglia. These two "classes" of memory are the focus of the DP model.</p>
<p>Formulating the Declarative/Procedural Model</p>
<p>The DP model posits that our brain encodes different components of language into distinct regions. This aligns with the pre-established memory systems associated with declarative and procedural memory. Previous research established two critical components of language.</p>
<p>Mental Lexicon and Mental Grammar</p>
<p>First, the mental lexicon refers to the collection of words in our mental repertoire. Essentially, it includes the connections the brain forms between a group of sounds and their meanings. The second component is mental grammar. This refers to the operations our brain performs to communicate using the mental lexicon. For instance, native English speakers can easily say, "I ate an apple" or "I’ll eat an apple." However, they do not consciously think about this process.</p>
<p>As Dr. Ullman analyzed his study participants, he noted striking contrasts in the types of language impairments seen with various neurological disorders. Alzheimer’s patients primarily displayed issues with learning and retrieving words, while those with Parkinson’s showed more grammatical errors.</p>
<p>While pondering this work during a hike, Dr. Ullman experienced an "aha moment," which led to the development of the DP model. He stated, “Grammatical deficits may be due to problems with underlying procedural memory; lexical deficits with declarative memory.” He recognized that as observational patterns aligned with the characteristic patterns of neurodegeneration in both diseases. Alzheimer’s involves degeneration in the temporal lobe structures, which relate to declarative memory, while Parkinson’s affects the basal ganglia, associated with procedural memory.</p>
<p>Scientific and Practical Applications of The DP Model</p>
<p>Language, Disorders, and Evolution</p>
<p>The DP model has extensive applications. Since Dr. Ullman introduced his theory in 2001, he has continued to explore various aspects of language neurocognition. His research includes second-language acquisition, bilingualism, and language disorders. It also covers other areas of cognition, such as math and music learning.</p>
<p>This model not only highlights the physical basis of language in clinical settings but also sheds light on important principles of evolutionary biology. These principles help scientists understand human linguistic development. “The procedural model is based on the idea in evolutionary biology that new functions tend to rely on existing mechanisms that are repurposed,” Dr. Ullman explained.</p>
<p>His model supports an evolutionary perspective, indicating that human capacity for language has organized itself within the brain's pre-existing learning structures — particularly those underlying declarative and procedural memory.</p>
<h2>Applications for Students: Optimizing Memory Science for Effective Learning</h2>
<p>Dr. Ullman’s work seamlessly bridges cognitive and linguistic functions with their underlying neurobiology. His findings contribute not only to language studies but also to broader research in learning and cognition.</p>
<p>Many students, especially those studying biology or psychology, engage in content memorization daily. This process heavily involves declarative memory — requiring them to understand principles and associate terms with their meanings. For instance, relating the term “mitochondria” to the phrase “powerhouse of the cell” is a form of declarative memory application.</p>
<p>The DP model provides insights that can enhance learning techniques. By identifying key brain regions involved in language memorization, such as the hippocampus and temporal lobe, researchers can develop optimal study strategies.</p>
<p>Currently, Dr. Ullman teaches Medical Neuroscience courses for medical students at Georgetown Medical School. Drawing from his research on declarative memory, he structures his lectures for effective learning. Dr. Ullman emphasizes strategies like repeated concept exposure and the benefits of spacing out these repetitions. He also stresses the importance of the “testing effect,” or “retrieval practice,” which highlights the value of actively recalling information for long-term memory formation.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: Integrating Language, Memory, and Mind</h2>
<p>As students navigate lectures and lab reports, they might perceive language and memory as separate systems. Dr. Ullman’s research reveals the interconnectedness between these systems. The DP model elucidates not only how the brain processes language but also how we can learn more effectively. Through understanding how we think, we also come to appreciate the evolution of our brain's functions. Whether memorizing metabolic pathways in biochemistry or synthesis reactions in organic chemistry, the brain constantly utilizes both declarative and procedural memory systems to comprehend the world. Dr. Ullman’s work advances our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying these functionalities, benefiting neuroscientists, psychologists, educators, and students alike.</p>

        excerpt: "Researchers in D.C. are revolutionizing AI, MS treatments, and cancer therapies."
        content: `<p>A building powered entirely by renewable energy might sound futuristic. For Professor Scott Sklar, however, it has long been a reality. His career began in the 1970s, a pivotal decade for American energy policy and the environmental movement.</p>
<p>Scott Sklar has dedicated his life to advancing renewable energy. From his early advocacy work to his current roles as the Sustainable Energy Director at GWU's Environment & Energy Management Institute and the Director of the George Washington Solar Institute, he has focused on innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Increased environmental awareness during the 1970s sparked his passion for sustainability. The Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act reshaped national priorities. His projects, which include solar panel installations in Singapore and solar-powered farms in Washington, D.C., demonstrate his belief: energy should be elegant, efficient, and accessible.</p>
<p>Today, he inspires the next generation of sustainable innovators. He actively promotes efficient energy, renewable resources, and creative design in his teaching.</p>
<p>Early Days and Motivations</p>
<p>During the 1970s and early 80s, the United States witnessed a surge in environmental awareness and activism. Major energy crises in 1973 and 1979, driven by geopolitical instability in the Middle East, disrupted oil exports.</p>
<p>While working as a legislative aide to New York Senator Jacob K. Javits, Sklar realized that most Congress members lacked knowledge about the energy industry. Although he faced challenges about accessing renewable resources without modern technology, he understood the need for renewable energy.</p>
<p>“No one’s going to interfere with your sunlight, your wind, your water, your heat... It was an inexhaustible supply,” Sklar stated. "It couldn’t be controlled by anyone."</p>
<p>This independence became a driving force for him. Traditional energy industries, such as oil and gas, aimed to maintain their monopoly over the market. Their pushback motivated Sklar to pursue renewable energy, develop clean power, and raise awareness surrounding energy issues.</p>
<p>The Potential of Energy Efficiency</p>
<p>Energy efficiency is not only a technical approach; it lays the foundation for sustainable design, aesthetics, and innovation. Before innovation can flourish, Sklar believes it is crucial to assess our current energy consumption, prioritizing efficiency and accessibility.</p>
<p>“I don’t want us to go 100% solar; I want us to go 100% maximum energy efficiency,” Sklar explained. “It’s always cheaper to save energy than to generate it from any source.”</p>
<p>In 1995, Sklar founded The Stella Group, Ltd. This global business focuses on “elegant integration,” which combines energy efficiency and renewable sources with energy storage. Now, as a professor at George Washington University's Sustainable Urban Planning Master of Professional Studies and Graduate School of Professional Studies, he teaches this philosophy. His courses, such as “Energy Resources” and “Renewable Energy & Critical Infrastructure,” emphasize these principles.</p>
<p>When discussing solar power, Sklar underscores the uniqueness of solar panels. He describes them as elegant, still, and having no moving parts at all.</p>
<p>“Even in the desert, we grow food,” he added. “There is sunlight everywhere.”</p>
<p>Solar technology is ubiquitous in society and can be integrated into various spaces—from rooftops to roadways and parking lots. The constant opportunity for innovation fuels Sklar's passion for sustainability. He remains committed to teaching and researching in this field.</p>
<p>Creative Side of Renewable Energy + Benefits</p>
<p>Creativity, aesthetics, and renewable energy are transforming modern architecture. Sklar's work in Singapore, where he integrated printed solar panels into building facades, exemplifies this trend. One captivating aspect was the chance to incorporate renewable energy within the building's design.</p>
<p>Alongside photovoltaics, solar daylighting harnesses natural light through windows or skylights, reducing the need for artificial lighting. In Sklar's home office, a solar daylighting "bubble" creates full-spectrum light, changing interior spaces dramatically. The possibilities are endless—options range from giant domes to pentagons.</p>
<p>Research indicates that full-spectrum light not only enhances aesthetics but also offers measurable mental and physical benefits. It can boost productivity, reduce illness among students and workers, and even increase retail sales.</p>
<p>For instance, solar-heated water is also promoted in Japan for its skin health benefits. It reduces allergies and improves overall well-being. Furthermore, the EU-funded TilePlus project, developed with support from Autarq and involving Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden, highlights how European architects are leading sustainable design. This project’s solar roofing shingles replace traditional materials, providing protection while generating electricity.</p>
<p>Transforming Access to Energy</p>
<p>Sklar’s focus extends beyond technology—he emphasizes the human impact of renewable energy products. A long-time advocate for sustainability, Sklar aims to inspire the next generation of clean energy innovators.</p>
<p>For example, lightweight, inflatable solar lights designed by South African students provide essential power to off-grid communities. These low-cost devices charge in sunlight for an hour, providing several hours of illumination. They drastically reduce reliance on kerosene, presenting a game-changing advantage in limiting crude oil dependency.</p>
<p>“We have over 8 billion people on this planet, a third of them have no electricity,” Sklar remarked, highlighting the disparities in energy access.</p>
<p>These advancements pave the way for innovations like solar water pumping and clean cooking. They show how even small ideas can significantly impact people's lives.</p>
<h2>Medical Resilience</h2>
<p>Sklar’s efforts also spill into the public health sector, where energy access can mean life or death. During an Ebola crisis in Africa, he met with World Health Organization (WHO) representatives after giving presentations to four African embassies in Washington, D.C. This collaboration aimed to address urgent energy gaps in rural clinics.</p>
<p>A lack of reliable power led to life-threatening challenges. Surgeries were performed under candlelight. Vaccines spoiled in powerless refrigerators, and medical equipment remained unsanitized.</p>
<p>To address these gaps, Sklar worked with the WHO and the United Nations to advocate for solar and wind clinics. By understanding medical providers' needs and assessing suitable technologies, his team deployed sustainable power systems. These systems, including solar and wind-powered clinics during a crisis, offer a blueprint for medical resilience in the future.</p>
<p>Agrivoltaics and Clean Farming</p>
<p>Sklar collaborated with Professor John Forrer at GWU on a Department of Energy (DOE) funded project focused on agrivoltaics. This initiative aimed to combat resistance against solar energy in rural areas.</p>
<p>Agrivoltaics involves raising solar panels high enough to allow tractors and farmers to pass beneath. They also provide shade, allowing crops to flourish.</p>

<p>Located at the convent on the Catholic University campus, this project doubles as a community garden. It is now recognized as the largest solar installation within the borders of Washington, D.C. The convent serves as a model for urban clean energy, blending agriculture and renewable energy generation.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: Inspiration for The Next Generation of Innovators</h2>
<p>Professor Sklar's work continues to motivate the next generation of clean energy innovators. Through teaching and global partnerships, he encourages students to think creatively while challenging conventional approaches.</p>
<p>The Catalyst looks forward to hosting Professor Sklar on an upcoming podcast, where he will delve deeper into the groundbreaking projects that inspire and energize him.</p>

        content: `<p>Rebecca Katz’s plan to volunteer in India was unraveled by a severe illness that doctors in the U.S. struggled to diagnose. After eight months, they found the cause: a rare pathogen once weaponized by the U.S. military. The surreal experience would change everything, leading her to become an expert on her own disease and discover a new calling at the intersection of public health and national security.</p>
<p>A Timely Intersection of Public Health and National Security</p>
<p>On September 10, 2001, a young Rebecca Katz, a public health doctoral student, submitted a paper outside the typical realm of classic epidemiology — Biological Weapons as a Public Health issue — a topic that was not widely covered at the time.</p>
<p>However, within less than a year, following both the attacks on 9/11 and the Anthrax Attacks, Katz’s interest in the intersection of public health and national security was no longer a science-fiction concept, but a part of a burgeoning field of medical research.</p>
<p>In her career since, Dr. Katz has demonstrated incredible efficacy for tackling critical issues ranging from biosecurity and urban planning to pandemic preparedness and disease outbreak emergency responses. The Catalyst had a chance to sit down with her and take a deep dive into her career and insights, spanning from governmental to academic work.</p>
<p>From Global Health to National Security</p>
<p>Katz’s career, like many, began with ambitions that looked quite different from where she ultimately landed. Raised in a family deeply rooted in public health, dinner table conversations didn’t revolve around investment banking or law school applications, but instead around health, equity, and the medical systems that shape people’s lives.</p>
<p>“I really thought I wanted to do a kind of resource allocation for global health policy,” Katz said. “I was going to be a health economist and study things like the impact of access to clean water.”</p>
<p>However, before jumping into graduate school to pursue this goal, Katz had an itch for something else: travel. Determined to immerse herself in the kind of global work she hoped to one day lead, she convinced her parents to support a year-long volunteer trip to India.</p>
<p>“I was going to spend a year doing volunteer work.” Katz said. “The plan was to spend the first six months in southern India working helping out in maternal and child health clinics and then spend the last six months volunteering for Mother Teresa.”</p>
<p>But that plan unraveled when Katz fell gravely ill. After just a few months, she was forced to cut her trip short and return to the U.S., where doctors struggled to diagnose her. For eight months, she remained sick while medical teams searched for answers. Ultimately, they discovered she had contracted a rare pathogen that had once been weaponized by the U.S. military in the 1950s as part of its former offensive biological weapons program.</p>
<p>This experience, harrowing and surreal, would change everything, she said.</p>
<p>While enduring her illness, Katz began her Master’s in Public Health at Yale University, choosing the school not just for its academics, but for its access to top-tier doctors to treat her illness. She found herself in a strange dual reality.</p>
<p>“I was discovering the field of epidemiology… And I was also becoming really smart on my own disease,” Katz said. “If you have the intellectual capacity to do so, you have to become your own advocate.”</p>
<p>In the process of becoming an expert in her own disease, Katz stumbled upon a body of literature about biological weapons and biodefense, topics that had not yet entered the mainstream of undergraduate study. Her experience gave her a uniquely visceral connection to the subject. With a background in policy, economics, and epidemiology, she saw a new convergence of disciplines: national security and global health.</p>
<p>Though there were few formal paths to follow in this emerging field, Katz couldn’t shake the feeling that this was where she was meant to be, she said. She began attending niche meetings, often the only woman in the room, and usually the youngest by far, slowly carving out space in a field that hadn’t yet fully formed.</p>
<p>Pioneering a New Field in the Wake of National Crises</p>
<p>By the time Katz decided to pursue a PhD in 2000, she had a clear idea of what she wanted to study: the intersection of disease and security. Most schools didn’t quite know what to make of her proposal, but Katz pushed forward, undeterred. Eventually, a former dean from her program at Yale, who had now moved to Princeton, encouraged her to pursue her graduate studies within their School of Public and International Affairs (formerly the Woodrow Wilson School). There, Katz had the opportunity to combine courses in Epidemiology and National Security, and would soon be writing about biological weapons as a public health threat — inadvertently submitting one of her exam papers on September 10, 2001.</p>
<p>“The thing everyone had been humoring me about, well, it became a real thing after 9/11 and the Anthrax attacks,” Katz said.</p>
<p>This background set the stage for a meteoric rise for the field of biosecurity, a sphere that Katz’s background perfectly aligned with. Here she sought out internships within the intelligence community and simultaneously collected data for her dissertation. Through an historical analysis of biological agents used in warfare, Katz declassified almost 9,000 pages of documents to finish her thesis.</p>
<p>From there, having earned her PhD, Dr. Katz began consulting for the U.S. Department of State. Between 2004 and 2019, she supported U.S. delegations to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) in Geneva, Switzerland, advising on global norms around the peaceful use of biological science and the prevention of biological weapons development.</p>

<p>In parallel, Katz worked closely with global partners, including the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Health Emergencies Programme, where she shared expertise on emergency preparedness and the International Health Regulations. At the policy level, Katz collaborated with ministries of health and foreign affairs in countries such as Uganda, India, and Jordan, helping to design and evaluate pandemic preparedness plans, infectious disease reporting systems, and public health emergency operations centers. Her advisory work has also extended to the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), where she has supported the design of the program..</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t long before Katz found herself drawn back into academia. In 2005, a former mentor encouraged her to lecture in his course at the George Washington University (GWU) School of Medicine. Lecturing led to more interactions with the GWU faculty, and soon the School of Public Health — now the Milken Institute School of Public Health — soon offered Katz a faculty position. There, she continued her work at the intersection of epidemiology and national security, ultimately receiving a prestigious K Award from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to support her research.</p>
<p>Still consulting with the State Department, Katz eventually transitioned her research group to Georgetown University in 2016. She now leads their Center for Global Health Science and Security, where she has continued to shape the field of health security through policy research, education, and public engagement.</p>
<p>Applying Decades of Experience to the Front Lines of a Global Pandemic</p>
<p>In early 2020, as the global threat of COVID-19 began to emerge, Katz’s years of experience positioned her at the forefront of the response. She was one of the first scientists in the United States to publicly call for the outbreak to be declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). On February 28, 2020, she published “The Novel Coronavirus Originating in Wuhan, China Challenges for Global Health Governance” as a warning.</p>
<p>“We are now faced with the very real prospect that COVID-19 may become a pandemic,” Katz wrote in the publication. “Health leaders and policymakers should begin to plan for a pandemic.”</p>
<p>While the WHO would not officially declare COVID-19 a pandemic until March 11, 2020,  Katz’s early call reflected the urgency that much of the public health community was beginning to feel.</p>
<p>Leading up to and following the 2020 election, Katz served on the Biden-Harris Transition COVID-19 team, helping shape public health strategies for the incoming administration. She also rejoined the State Department, serving under Secretary Antony Blinken as a senior advisor on pandemic response and global health security.</p>
<p>For Katz and others in the field, identifying public health as a national security challenge became a lot more apparent after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>A Framework for Future Preparedness Through Interdisciplinary Collaboration</p>
<p>Katz has spent much of her career thinking about that question. For her, the answer is not rooted in a single discipline, tool, or institution. It is about collaboration.</p>
<p>“When you’re responding to an outbreak, you don't just need epidemiologists. You need virologists, clinicians, politicians, economists, logisticians, behavioral scientists,” she said.</p>
<p>In theory, that level of coordination sounds simple. In practice, it remains elusive.</p>
<p>“A challenge in academia is that it’s still organized in silos, but the problems we face are multidisciplinary,” Katz said.</p>
<p>This obstacle was part of what motivated Katz to move her lab from GWU to Georgetown, where she hoped to foster a more multidisciplinary approach to research. However, interdisciplinarity amongst departments is not enough. Katz also believes Washington, D.C. holds a unique position in the field of health security.</p>
<p>“The proximity to decision-makers is critical. You can walk down the street and have a coffee with someone at the HHS or State Department,” Katz said. “It’s not just about being near them — it’s about having a relationship where people know your work and trust your judgment.”</p>
<p>To help bridge these gaps, Katz and her team have launched several tools and initiatives aimed at building stronger, data-driven responses to pandemics. This includes the Analysis and Mapping of Policies for Emerging Infectious Diseases (AMPED) project that catalogues global health policies and how they may affect outbreak outcomes.</p>
<p>These tools reflect a core principle in Katz’s work: knowledge should be actionable. Whether writing early warnings, creating digital tools for decision-makers, or mentoring the next generation of public health leaders, her focus remains the same.</p>
<p>The next pandemic is not a question of if, but when. The better the nation understands the systems that failed — and the people and partnerships that responded — the more prepared the country and the world will be to face the music.</p>

        content: `<p>With rising seas and worsening droughts, coastal forests face an uncertain future. Scientist Riley Leff dives deep into the hidden strategies trees use to survive extreme stress, from strategic growth spurts to surprising water-handling tactics. Could understanding trees’ secret survival playbook help protect entire ecosystems, and even our planet?</p>
<p>Balancing Act at the Water’s Edge</p>
<p>You stand tall on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. With the sun beating down on you, it's hard to catch your breath. Breathing faster only makes you thirstier, and you wonder when you will get a much-needed break. This is the life of a coastal tree: rooted in place, exposed to the elements, and constantly balancing the need for water, sunlight, and growth. A tree’s response to its environment changes throughout its life, allowing it to meet its needs at any time. Its ability to respond to the needs of its environment is crucial, as it can determine whether it thrives or is outcompeted by its neighbors. Trees employ different structural and physiological tactics to match their local conditions at each developmental stage, but that careful balance can be greatly disrupted by events like climate change, putting whole ecosystems at risk.</p>
<h2>Timing is Everything: Growth Strategies</h2>
<p>Early in life, spending energy on growth is a tree’s most vital investment. Young trees receive small amounts of available light, and without the ability to move, this resource — in addition to soil nutrients — is fixed. If a tree doesn’t develop enough early on, it is at risk of being dominated by larger neighbors and losing available resources. Investing more into upward growth for canopy height or downward growth for root spread helps a tree outcompete its neighbors and monopolize its local resources. Strategic phenological differences show up early on, with some juvenile trees budding and leafing out earlier than adult trees, according to the U.S. Forest Service.</p>
<p>A tree’s strategy throughout a given year can vary greatly as well, especially in temperate biomes. During the wet, resource-rich growing season, some trees add “earlywood”: thinner, porous wood. As conditions grow harsher and drier later in the year, trees add denser, thicker-walled cells, creating the dark bands of the recognizable tree rings. The thickness of a ring can offer clues about how favorable growing conditions were in a given year. Tree rings are vital to the science of dendrochronology, or the science of studying the history of trees through their rings.</p>

Brackets highlight how thick rings correspond to years with high precipitation and thin rings to years with low precipitation.</p>

<p>Unlocking the Tree’s Inner Workings</p>
<p>Riley Leff, a PhD candidate at the George Washington University (GWU), studies how coastal trees respond to sea level rise. He has spent the past four years studying saltwater-inundated forests, observing that while there has been a significant change in vegetation composition, with shrubs and the invasive perennial grass Phragmites expanding through the forest, the trees have barely changed. Despite living in adverse conditions with high salinity and multiple floods a year, there hasn’t been significant tree mortality in the short term, Leff said. To uncover how these trees persist under extreme stress, Leff is studying how these trees respond to harsh conditions and what adaptations allow them to be more resilient.</p>
<p>Early in his PhD, Leff utilized the Sperry model when studying reverse sap flux events in trees, a process in which water travels downward through a plant's root system, opposite to the typical upward movement that occurs during transpiration. He observed that trees can survive floods with little to no health deficits by dispersing the load across different aspects of their physiology.</p>
<p>Leff wants to understand how the different internal systems of trees are coordinated at the organismal and ecosystem levels.</p>
<p>“From the physiological level to the whole system level is where we’re zooming to, asking where the incentives are,” he said.</p>
<p>Leff explained that he finds coastal forests specifically fascinating for studying tree decisions due to the high variability across a site, where some areas are dominated by older trees, while others affected by salinity form canopy gaps that young plants must rapidly compete to fill. These variations in vegetation lead to different types of tree competition, and studying how these dynamics change over time under the stress of sea-level rise provides a unique perspective on tree physiology and strategy.</p>
<p>Although there is well-established knowledge of chemical and physiological aspects of tree growth, there is more to be learned about how these processes scale up when trees are under stress. Leff explained that his research studies different aspects of tree mechanics under hydraulic stress. These aspects are displayed in prominent modeling, with models like the Sperry model, which helps predict trees' responses to drought, and the FATES model, which outlines how individuals or groups of trees live under different resource stresses and competition dynamics. Advanced modeling offers clues into the science of these processes at multiple levels.</p>
<p>“The challenge we face as ecologists is taking what we can be really sure of and scaling it,” Leff said.</p>
<h2>Forest Royale: Learning Tree Survival Through Play</h2>
<p>Leff said he was inspired by the April 8th Bio Grad Student Council science fair at GWU and wanted to create an educational supplement to help share his ideas with a wider audience, including kids. He created Forest Royale, a game where the player is a tree with the ability to make decisions about carbon allocation and water uptake to survive and grow. Leff said a game seemed like an excellent idea to complement his poster and get his audience more excited about the tree physiology he is studying.</p>

<p>Why Tree Strategies Matter for Our Future</p>
<p>It is urgent to understand how trees adapt to environmental stressors, especially in an era of rising sea levels and increasing droughts. Trees, with long life spans and immobility, are especially vulnerable to these environmental changes that upset their delicate balance.</p>
<p>Predicting how trees respond to adverse conditions can shape how humans manage forests around the world. According to the United Nations, forests make up 31 percent of the world, providing habitats for 80 percent of terrestrial organisms that live on, in, or around them. Trees’ response to environmental stressors can propagate through ecosystems, and their important role in carbon sequestration can affect the whole planet, making it extremely important to understand and protect them.</p>

        content: `<p>While neurons often take center stage in discussions about the brain, other cells play equally vital roles. This article shines a light on the often-overlooked astrocyte, revealing its critical functions in neuronal communication, protection, and metabolic support.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Since publishing An Ode to Microglia seven months ago, I have been consumed by a sense of guilt—one that I finally wish to unload. Today, I come forth with a confession to you all: I am nominating a different cell for the glial throne. In all fairness, when I wrote An Ode to Microglia, I never claimed that it was the best, but argued it is unfairly shadowed by the awesomeness of its peer, the neuron. I now realize, however, that in awarding the microglia the attention it deserves, I unjustly dismissed another hero. But alas, I return to correct my misdeed. I present to you, An Ode to the Astrocyte.</p>

<h2>Rediscovering the Brain's "Glue": The Evolving Understanding of Glial Cells</h2>
<p>For years, scientists significantly underestimated the role of glial cells in the brain. The term neuroglia itself was coined by German pathologist Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow in 1858 when, observing strange masses surrounding neurons, he figured they were connective tissue—the “glue”—of the brain. We now know that glial cells are a world of their own, but if one of them truly “holds it together,” you could make a solid case for the astrocyte. One of the key ideas preached in every cell biology class is that structure defines function. Named with the Greek prefix “astro-” due to its stellated shape, the astrocyte not only looks like a star, it is one.</p>
<p>The Tripartite Synapse and Astrocyte's Role in Neuronal Communication</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, neurobiologists have expanded their understanding of the synapse—the space between two communicating neurons where one releases ions onto the next, in order to propagate an electrical signal. A new notion, coined the “tripartite synapse,” conveys a fuller picture of neuronal communication that occurs in many regions of the brain, composed of three partners: two neurons and an astrocyte. Just as a chef developing a new recipe will taste and make adjustments before delivering it to customers, the astrocyte adjusts the chemical environment between neurons and even releases some of its own, to ensure that the transmitted signal is perfect. Scientists have discovered that astrocytes express receptors for certain signal molecules, called neurotransmitters. When neurotransmitters bind, they trigger intracellular changes to Ca2+ concentrations in the astrocytes, which may prompt them to release their own neurotransmitters as well to strengthen, weaken, or fine-tune the neuronal signal.</p>

<p>In addition to releasing signals of its own, the astrocyte can also uptake neurotransmitters from the synapse to both prevent toxic signaling and convert them to different molecular forms that can be reused by neurons. Glutamate, the brain’s primary excitatory neurotransmitter, is known to cause an event called excitotoxicity when released in surplus. As the name suggests, excitotoxicity is deadly to neurons and is associated with a multitude of disorders ranging from ALS, Huntington’s Disease, and Multiple Sclerosis, to Epilepsy, Schizophrenia, and Autism., Astrocytes play a crucial role in modulating glutamate signaling by taking up any excess, converting it to its precursor form, and transporting it back to the neurons to reuse when needed.</p>
<h2>Astrocytes: Guardians of the Brain and Metabolic Powerhouses</h2>
<p>Excitotoxicity is not the only danger that the astrocyte protects us from. Beyond their roles at the neuronal synapse, astrocytes also associate with the capillaries of the brain. By wrapping their fine, limb-like extensions around endothelial cells and secreting special molecules, they promote their adhesion to reinforce the semi-permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Due to the inability of neurons to regenerate, this function is crucial for preventing the entry of harmful chemicals that may cause neuronal injury. When we go to sleep, astrocytes use their aquaporin channels to circulate fluid in the brain, helping to flush out any toxins or waste that may have accumulated.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, astrocytes use their close contact with blood vessels to absorb glucose, convert it to lactate, and shuttle it to neurons. During periods of high brain activity, such as memory formation, this becomes especially beneficial. Instead of performing ten metabolic reactions to convert glucose to pyruvate,  lactate only requires one.</p>
<h2>Concluding Remarks: A Call for Recognition</h2>
<p>Astrocyte wearing a crown and #1 trophy</p>
<p>For too long, the narrative of the brain has been neuron-centric, like imagining a galaxy with only one type of planet. The more we learn about the complex relationships that constitute our brains, the clearer it becomes that no single cell acts in isolation. Yet, if there is one cell that truly holds it all together—the tireless soldier that holds up the forts of the nervous system while nourishing its neighboring neurons and providing metabolic support—it is the “star”-cell. My previous ode celebrated the important contributions of the microglia, and rightly so. But in rectifying that oversight, I hope to have shone a deserving spotlight on the astrocyte, whose functions are, quite literally, central to our ability to think, feel, and function. The story of the astrocyte is far from fully written, inviting a new generation of scientists to continue uncovering its secrets and revolutionizing our understanding of the brain.</p>
