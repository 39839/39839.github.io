In a conversion about his journey from his graduate studies in Chemistry at Georgetown University, to his current work as a physical scientist in the Forensic Services Division of the United States Secret Service, Dr. Lucas Kane describes his journey exploring his interests and navigating the stressful world of career-searching to land his current position."

Kane completed his PhD at Georgetown this past summer (2024) and began his new work as a Forensic Chemist in the United States Secret Service, developing new and innovative forensic analysis methodologies."

Conversing with students who’ve carved out their own path can provide invaluable insights into the process of effectively navigating these questions throughout your studies."

Though initially more math and physics-oriented, Kane was inspired by Dr. Lori Kurth, his junior and senior-year Chemistry teacher. Fascinated by the problem-solving nature of chemistry, and the opportunity to pursue an education that delves into the molecular composition of life, Kane decided to major in Chemistry."

Interested in research on clean energy, Kane wanted to study nitrogen reduction for its potential applications in converting atmospheric nitrogen to clean fuel. But after two and a half years of work, Kane was required to pivot when his mentor left Georgetown. Faced with the options to either move and join Warren in Michigan, or begin anew at Georgetown, he chose the latter."

Transitioning towards organic synthesis strategies, he focused on carbon-fluorine bond functionalization; essentially replacing carbon-fluorine bonds with carbon-carbon bonds. Though highly available in the environment– often as pollutants– fluorinated organics are a problematic nuisance due to the high electronegativity difference between carbon and fluorine, which renders the C-F bond highly stable."

He also emphasizes the importance of clear communication throughout the process.

With that said, his story can provide valuable insights into the process of career exploration, and transition from the world of academia to your vocational destination. In college– especially among the fields of STEM– there exists a strong culture of setting far-out goals and pursuing them methodically, by systematically checking the boxes of the pre-med/nursing/engineering– you name it– requirements and expectations. In doing so, it becomes difficult to open your eyes and mind to other possibilities, and to allow yourself to explore your own interests.
