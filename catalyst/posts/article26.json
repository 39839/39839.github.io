However, much is still unknown about the development and treatment of autoimmune diseases, due to their low prevalence and requirement for highly specialized care. Despite its rarity myasthenia gravis (MG), or “grave muscle”, is among the most well-studied muscular autoimmune disorders currently documented[A]. Henry Kaminski, a leading expert on MG, is a professor of neurology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences."

After graduating residency, I decided to work with this MD/PhD Neurologist, who made the mistake of giving me a project to write a review article on Myasthenia Gravis. From there [it was fascinating to me], and the rest is history—it continues to be more fascinating as we grow, and now with the collaborations and capabilities I have, [there’s always more we can do].”"

        "content": "Autoimmune diseases are characterized by unintended antibody production and activity—targeting and deactivating self-produced, necessary proteins [B]. In the case of MG the antibody types, and therefore, targeted proteins can vary; the overarching determinant of this disease stems from antibodies targeting proteins on the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) within skeletal muscles [C]. This junction is important to facilitate the communication between the brain and the muscles—dysfunction of these junctions can give rise to many symptoms associated with MG, ranging from limited muscle strength and involvement to much more serious problems, such as respiratory failure. As general, nonspecific immunosuppression treatment has long been outdated and associated with increased risk for disease [D], the search for efficient targeted treatment of MG is an ongoing challenge.

        "content": "Because the mechanisms of MG are pretty well known, new therapies are made to target particular pressure points of the disease. Kaminski highlights a few leading strategies that have been subject to ongoing research: FcRn inhibitors are now commonplace in autoimmune treatment. Under normal circumstances, our bodies have the ability to recycle antibodies in the blood, protecting them from degradation [E]. This process occurs through neonatal Fc receptors—cell surface proteins that antibodies bind to in order to be internalized and processed, before being released back into the bloodstream. Specially developed inhibitors block this process by acting as a competitive inhibitor of the Fc receptor, as a way to ensure malignant antibodies are no longer in circulation. Another strategy, complement inhibition, involves not the targeting of the antibody itself, but the pathway of activation for MG. Rogue antibodies activate a series of enzymatic reactions known as the complement system, the end result forming a protein complex that breaks down important cells within the NMJ [F]. Ultimately, this leads to the destruction of acetyl choline receptors in the muscle, hindering neuromuscular communication [G]. Complement inhibitors seek to stop this process and inhibit the pathway by targeting specific, necessary proteins for its continuation."

        "content": "An important next step in MG drug development research that Kamiski is working towards involves improving technology that is specific for the cells producing the malignant antibodies. While a clear solution proves to elude scientists, the overarching challenges are evident—specificity is incredibly important, and may be the key doctors need for future treatment—both in the context of targeted therapies, and the development of personalized patient care plans to combat the high complexity of MG. Rapidly growing and improving in not just current clinical research, but all scientific fields, is the utilization of mathematical models to capture data for predicted outcomes of complex problems. This method for developing a specialized treatment course has already proven to be successful in the context of host-tumor interactions for cancer treatment, which reveal how an individual’s immune system reacts to not just the growth of cancerous cells, but continued treatment and immunotherapy [H]. Kaminski believes, working among peers and mathematicians, that these models are the future of more personalized and targeted treatment for MG patients; newer methods such as these have the capability to shed the limitations of previous strategies for combatting MG."
