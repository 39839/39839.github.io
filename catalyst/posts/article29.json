Climate change and other forms of environmental degradation pose serious development threats to children, as they are more biologically vulnerable than adults. At the same time, they also tend to disproportionately harm racially marginalized populations.",

Climate change and other forms of environmental degradation pose serious development threats to children, as they are more biologically vulnerable than adults. At the same time, they also tend to disproportionately harm racially marginalized populations, which is often an ongoing result of discriminatory historical practices—a phenomenon known as environmental racism. Children in marginalized communities are thus at the center of this dangerous intersection, and those in D.C. are no exception."

        "content": "Environmental racism in the U.S. today is often a result of discriminatory housing practices that began as early as the 1930s. In 1933, the U.S. federal government established the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC) in response to the Great Depression, which created a zoning system that categorized neighborhoods across the country from desirable (or “green”) to hazardous (or “red”), which became known as redlining. Redlining led to racist policies that prevented Black people from buying homes in certain “green” areas, and highways were often built to further separate redlined neighborhoods and communities of color. Even today, formerly redlined areas have less green space, higher levels of air pollution, and higher surface temperatures than those rated “green” nearly a century ago."

        "content": "Present day macro-social factors continue to promote and exacerbate racism, which is becoming even more dangerous in the context of climate change. Discrimination in zoning laws and housing markets keep people of color concentrated in the same polluted areas and make it difficult for them to move elsewhere. This further perpetuates power differences and limits these populations from being involved in decision-making about hazardous pollution sites. These areas face notable environmental hazards, such as higher heat indices, increased exposure to noise, air, and water pollution, and decreased access to resources such as food, green space, healthcare, transportation, and social services. Children are also still seeing the effects of historical redlining today; for instance, a 2020 study found that rates of asthma-related emergency room visits were 2.4 times higher for children living in previously redlined areas in eight different California cities (Nardone et al., 2020), and a 2017 study found higher levels of both indoor and outdoor air pollution in New Jersey zip codes with a majority Black population (Alexander & Currie, 2017)."

        "content": "The climate crisis threatens all humans, but children are particularly at risk. Four key development factors drive this vulnerability: consumption, as children eat, drink, and breathe more per pound of body weight than adults do; contact, as children often engage in behaviors like putting their hands in their mouths; immunity, as children’s immune systems are not yet as strong as those of adults; and exposure time, given that children have more time to develop health conditions from early exposure. Children’s developing bodies also take longer to process and remove toxic materials they have ingested, meaning that pollutants remain in their bodies longer than they do in adults."

Indirect effects include exposure to conflict, shortage of resources, malnutrition, or climate-driven migration. And these impacts can be deadly: the World Health Organization found that environmental hazards were responsible for 26% of global deaths among children younger than five years old in 2017."

These children tend to face higher levels of air pollution, as they are more likely to live in historically redlined neighborhoods. Many also live near other sources of pollution such as busy roads or factories, and walk to school or use public transportation, increasing their exposure to outdoor air pollution. They are often subject to higher levels of indoor air pollution as well, as they are more likely to live in smaller homes with more people and less ventilation; they also may not have a separate kitchen and living space, increasing exposure to cooking fuels and other air pollutants. Ingesting air pollutants can have adverse respiratory effects, varying from sickness and infections to more serious issues like developmental delays, mental health issues, or even changes to DNA methylation."

Black children in the U.S. are exposed to significantly higher levels of lead than any other racial group, and there is no safe level of lead exposure in early childhood development. These children often ingest lead-based paint in houses built before 1978, another result of structural racism in housing practices resulting from historical redlining."

Only weeks after Flint officials switched the city’s water source prematurely, residents began complaining about the water quality and resulting adverse health effects—yet it still took over a year to be acknowledged and addressed. An estimated 9,000 children under age six were exposed to lead-contaminated water for 18 months. Affected Flint residents also saw a 12% drop in fertility rates and 58% increase in fetal mortality related to the change in water supply."

        "content": "More broadly, it is clear that environmental racism only perpetuates a vicious cycle. Racism worsens adverse impacts of environmental problems: factors such as poverty, maternal financial hardship, and poor diet can amplify the toxic effects of air pollution and other exposure to chemicals on children’s cognitive abilities. Environmental racism also exacerbates poverty, as those who live in poverty are more likely to be exposed to environmental hazards, subjecting them to more adverse health outcomes. This ultimately impacts caregivers’ abilities to work and provide for their families, but also children’s development and their future capabilities."

People living in metropolitan areas with high levels of segregation, like D.C., are more likely to be exposed to air pollutants, and the difference between white and minority populations exposed to multiple types of air pollution is more pronounced in these areas. For example, rates of lifetime prevalence of asthma are significantly higher among both children and adults in D.C. than national averages—but when broken down by race, the rate among Black children is 23% but only 6.5% among white children."

The Anacostia River (which cuts through southeast D.C.) has higher levels of E. coli bacteria and turbidity, measuring below district standards, than the Potomac River (which runs along the western border)."

As of August 2025, they are 23.1% of the way there, having already completed over 9,000 replacements. To reduce air pollution, the district’s Department of Energy and Environment launched the Carbon Free DC campaign in 2023 — which aims to make D.C. carbon neutral by 2045 — meaning that the city won’t release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than it removes. Carbon Free DC outlines other sustainability goals as well, including improving housing, transportation, accessibility of needs for residents in environmentally friendly ways."

Despite this, the administration has cancelled hundreds of grants awarded through the EPA’s environmental and climate justice grant program, putting those most impacted by environmental hazards even more at risk."

Promotive factors also include better health policy and easier access to adequate healthcare for minority populations, as they improve the lives of caregivers and therefore children. Education and awareness are also necessary: everyone who touches children’s lives, from parents to policymakers, has to be well-informed to stop perpetuating harmful habits and promote safer, healthier practices."
