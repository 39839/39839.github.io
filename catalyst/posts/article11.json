On the day of course registration, Cahill happened to be in line next to chemistry professor James Bowser, who recommended that Cahill take a few core science classes. Despite the radical pivot, with just one introductory course in chemistry and another in geology, he was hooked - acquiring a BS in Chemistry and Geochemistry and igniting a lifelong passion."

Parise during an undergraduate research internship at Stony Brook University, Cahill would apply to Parise’ lab again to pursue a PhD in Chemistry. Surrounded by like-minded, intellectually engaging individuals at Stony Brook and with access to Brookhaven National Lab, a Department of Energy facility, Cahill cultivated his zeal for crystallography and materials chemistry. Driven by his love for chemistry and interest in crystals and minerals, Cahill pursued a postdoc in the Environmental Mineralogy Group at Notre Dame University, where he worked on characterizing natural uranium minerals to consider their potential applications in nuclear waste storage or geologic repositories."

This relatively novel area of research is rapidly expanding and presents a compelling challenge to synthesize materials with enhanced functionality and performance for innovative applications. While their inorganic components provide a stable and rigid framework, the organic components enable flexibility to customize novel or enhanced materials with unique properties. Expanding the library of synthetic hybrid materials requires optimizing the approach of assembling chemical constituents to maximize the synergy of organic-inorganic frameworks. "
