Breathing faster only makes you thirstier, and you wonder when you will get a much-needed break. This is the life of a coastal tree: rooted in place, exposed to the elements, and constantly balancing the need for water, sunlight, and growth. A tree’s response to its environment changes throughout its life, allowing it to meet its needs at any time. Its ability to respond to the needs of its environment is crucial, as it can determine whether it thrives or is outcompeted by its neighbors. Trees employ different structural and physiological tactics to match their local conditions at each developmental stage, but that careful balance can be greatly disrupted by events like climate change, putting whole ecosystems at risk."

        "content": "Early in life, spending energy on growth is a tree’s most vital investment. Young trees receive small amounts of available light, and without the ability to move, this resource — in addition to soil nutrients — is fixed. If a tree doesn’t develop enough early on, it is at risk of being dominated by larger neighbors and losing available resources. Investing more into upward growth for canopy height or downward growth for root spread helps a tree outcompete its neighbors and monopolize its local resources. Strategic phenological differences show up early on, with some juvenile trees budding and leafing out earlier than adult trees, according to the U.S. Forest Service."

        "content": "A tree’s strategy throughout a given year can vary greatly as well, especially in temperate biomes. During the wet, resource-rich growing season, some trees add “earlywood”: thinner, porous wood. As conditions grow harsher and drier later in the year, trees add denser, thicker-walled cells, creating the dark bands of the recognizable tree rings. The thickness of a ring can offer clues about how favorable growing conditions were in a given year. Tree rings are vital to the science of dendrochronology, or the science of studying the history of trees through their rings."

He has spent the past four years studying saltwater-inundated forests, observing that while there has been a significant change in vegetation composition, with shrubs and the invasive perennial grass Phragmites expanding through the forest, the trees have barely changed. Despite living in adverse conditions with high salinity and multiple floods a year, there hasn’t been significant tree mortality in the short term, Leff said. To uncover how these trees persist under extreme stress, Leff is studying how these trees respond to harsh conditions and what adaptations allow them to be more resilient."

        "content": "Early in his PhD, Leff utilized the Sperry model when studying reverse sap flux events in trees, a process in which water travels downward through a plant's root system, opposite to the typical upward movement that occurs during transpiration. He observed that trees can survive floods with little to no health deficits by dispersing the load across different aspects of their physiology. Leff wants to understand how the different internal systems of trees are coordinated at the organismal and ecosystem levels."

        "content": "Leff explained that he finds coastal forests specifically fascinating for studying tree decisions due to the high variability across a site, where some areas are dominated by older trees, while others affected by salinity form canopy gaps that young plants must rapidly compete to fill. These variations in vegetation lead to different types of tree competition, and studying how these dynamics change over time under the stress of sea-level rise provides a unique perspective on tree physiology and strategy."

        "content": "Although there is well-established knowledge of chemical and physiological aspects of tree growth, there is more to be learned about how these processes scale up when trees are under stress. Leff explained that his research studies different aspects of tree mechanics under hydraulic stress. These aspects are displayed in prominent modeling, with models like the Sperry model, which helps predict trees' responses to drought, and the FATES model, which outlines how individuals or groups of trees live under different resource stresses and competition dynamics. Advanced modeling offers clues into the science of these processes at multiple levels."

Leff said a game seemed like an excellent idea to complement his poster and get his audience more excited about the tree physiology he is studying."
