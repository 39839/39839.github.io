        "content": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that damages the nervous system. Patients can experience numerous symptoms, ranging from fatigue, impaired vision, and decreased motor coordination, to memory deficits and difficulties with bowel and bladder function. Despite being one of the most common autoimmune disorders in the world, with 2.9 million people estimated to suffer from the disease in 2023, there are currently no cures available for MS. Recent advances in the field, however, offer new hope for patients. One such example is the exciting work conducted by Dr. Jeffrey Huang, whose lab at Georgetown University holds a patent for a potential new MS drug. Based out of nation’s capital, Dr. Huang and his team at Georgetown University are targeting an amino acid transporter that they recently identified, with the goal of reducing disease severity for MS patients. In this exclusive interview, Dr. Huang shares the journey that led him to his breakthrough discovery, additional successes along the way, and the path that led him to his impactful research on MS."

While the initial pathological event driving MS progression involves the infiltration of immune cells into the brain and spinal cord, symptoms of the disease primarily result from a process called “demyelination,” in which immune cells destroy myelin, an important structure in the brain that coats neurons."

        "content": "Similar to the insulation on an electrical wire, our brain relies on a special coating called myelin to transmit high-speed electrical signals from one neuron to the next. This structure is formed by a population of cells in the brain known as oligodendrocytes, which send out extensions of their membrane and wrap them around neurons, creating dozens of insulating layers. While brain activity is primarily mediated by neurons, which send electrical signals to one another in the form of ion currents, myelin plays a key role in the process. By preventing ions from leaking out along the neuronal membrane, this protective coating ensures smooth, lag-free conduction. Myelin enables the high-speed signaling that our brain requires to rapidly respond to information from our surroundings in real time."

        "content": "Myelin also provides physical protection for neurons which, in contrast to oligodendrocytes, are unable to regenerate. The brain contains a large reservoir of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which remyelinate neurons in response to injury. In healthy brains, remyelination is important to re-establish normal signaling—but in certain pathological conditions, it fails over time. In MS, specifically, patients often experience cycles of demyelination and remyelination for several years. Eventually, however, they enter a progressive stage of the disease where this natural repair process fails."
