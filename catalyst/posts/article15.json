From an early age, Harris loved both science and medicine and decided to pursue both, he said. As a physician-scientist, Dr. Harris’s work ranges from brain tissue lab research to extensive patient care. After completing his MD/PhD at Georgetown University, Harris conducted his Residency Pathology at Stanford University Medical School. Harris returned to his alma mater in 2010, this time as a Georgetown Medical School professor. He has since established the Georgetown Brain Bank and POND Bank, in addition to assuming the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for DC. Here he has been utilizing his proximity to the capital to initiate and lead many programs to advance the treatment and research for neuroinflammatory diseases including working with National organizations such as NIH."

In undergraduate, he pursued a Liberal Arts degree and balanced this with courses in the natural sciences. Before long, he found himself in a Summer program at the National Institutes of Health and decided he was going to pursue a career in the biomedical sciences. Once he completed a Master's in Biochemistry, he decided he finally was ready to apply to Medical School and devote his career in Medicine."

He describes them as “banks” in the truest sense, where clinical data, tissue, and fluids are carefully collected, classified, and stored for future research. This process allows researchers to study diseases like ALS at an unprecedented depth, leveraging tools like genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics —“Any omics you can think of,” as Dr. Harris describes.

Oftentimes researchers can discern the presence of hereditary diseases through the proper use of brain banks when connected to deceased family members. Here Dr. Harris can merge his two expertise, as he can clinically consent and work with the patients and then utilize his background in pathology to collect and understand tissue samples. "

        "content": "However, the ability to host and store these tissues is quite difficult, considering the IRB approval necessary to collect the tissues and the economic upkeep of the physical space of these sensitive gigabytes of information. Here, Dr. Harris sets himself apart due to his unwavering commitment to the public good and the use of his resources. Through Georgetown’s prominence in the U.S. capital, Dr. Harris has been able to continually fight for grants to upkeep the Georgetown Brain Bank and simultaneously start new initiatives across the United States. With developments in Machine Learning and improving the speed of analysis and the accuracy of reports, each brain tissue is becoming increasingly more valuable in the information they can provide. Therefore, Dr. Harris and his team’s work is not only actively supporting patients directly, but indirectly leading to discoveries in labs across the nation. Dr Harris recognizes that a paper can only do so much and through providing tissue samples to other researchers, he exponentially advances the research for neurodegenerative diseases one brain at a time."

        "content": "Dr. Harris’s work extends beyond the lab and brain bank, reflecting his unwavering commitment to understanding and combating devastating neurological diseases. Currently Dr. Harris finds his most far-reaching work through the legislative initiatives started by governmental organizations. As part of the ALL ALS initiative, Dr. Harris played a pivotal role in passing legislation to bolster funding and accessibility for brain banks and research sites across the United States. This initiative represents a monumental leap in uniting clinical and translational research, enabling 35 sites nationwide to collect brain tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. These resources are critical for identifying early biomarkers and therapeutic targets, with the ultimate goal of transforming ALS from a fatal disease into a treatable condition. The ALL ALS initiative exemplifies the power of \"team science,\" where neurologists, molecular biologists, and bioengineers collaborate to address one of neuroscience’s most pressing challenges. Dr. Harris underscores that this collaborative approach allows for the integration of diverse expertise, which is essential to tackling the complex mechanisms underlying ALS."

        "content": "Dr. Harris’s dedication to advancing ALS research is also evident in his leadership of the Target ALS program. This initiative was created to address a significant gap in ALS research: the availability of high-quality tissues and biofluids for scientific study. As a neuropathologist and Director of the Georgetown Brain Bank, Dr. Harris has championed the importance of brain banks as foundational tools in research. For Dr. Harris, neuropathology is more than a field—it is a vocation that bridges science and medicine. His work highlights the critical role of neuropathologists as collaborators and stewards of human tissue, advancing both research and patient care. As he explains, neuropathologists are uniquely positioned to teach others about the human aspect of diseases and their pathological underpinnings. By enabling researchers to access high-quality, anonymized samples, Dr. Harris’s brain bank supports scientific discovery and honors the profound generosity of donors and their families. This ethos extends to his research, where he uses advanced molecular biology and cutting-edge tools like machine learning to explore how glial cells contribute to disease. Dr. Harris’s work is a testament to the transformative potential of neuropathology, uniting clinical insight and scientific inquiry to combat ALS and other neurological diseases."

As Harris said, “There is no place I would rather be” when I asked why he continued to pursue his research and work in the Capital of the United States. Dr Harris reminds all of us that our unique interests can be melded together and in fact beneficial to our careers. Moreover, sometimes the most valuable thing we can do is put ourselves in the right place to let our work impact the most people."
