However, it is not always obvious what path your interests will lead you down. In many cases, this induces anxiety for those pursuing a career in STEM, as we are told to “figure out what you want to do” for the rest of your life. Sitting down with Professor Michael Keidar, we will trace the steps of his illustrious career backwards, learning about how he tackled these exact questions that landed him to work in applying his knowledge across diverse fields such as brain tumor therapy, satellite design, and electromagnetic-induced drug delivery."

Typically, with plasma-induced propulsion, ions are expelled and induce a “jet effect”. Issues arise when the positive ions are ejected, as they take the positive charge and leave the satellite negatively charged. On large scales, such as a satellite, this induces such a large negative electrical differential that the positively charged particles are attracted back to the spacecraft, inhibiting the electromagnetic force.

Put simply, how can oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere help to solve this problem? One effect of oxygen at low energy is that electrons actually attach to oxygen atoms more strongly than the positively charged ions from the spacecraft. Thus, an expulsion of oxygen could potentially counterbalance the ionic buildup of negative charges."

Now, with this database of chemical interactions, it was possible for Keidar to predict the outcomes of his plasma’s effects more precisely. These same species are the ones that interact in the Atmosphere."
