        "content": "From the development of robots in the early 20th century to the robotic boom of the 1980s, the idea of surgical robots belonged to the realm of science fiction. Yet by 1985, the first steps toward commercialization had begun. Surgeons adapted the PUMA 560, an industrial robotic arm originally designed for factory automation, to guide a needle during CT-guided brain biopsies. In that first successful use, the robot performed a delicate brain tissue sampling with unprecedented steadiness, demonstrating that machines could deliver precision beyond the limits of the human hand."

        "content": "By the early 2000s, robotic platforms such as Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci® had entered operating rooms worldwide. Their rise coincided with growing demand for less invasive technologies, hospital competition for technological prestige, and surgeon interest in tools that could reduce fatigue and improve precision. This convergence of clinical, commercial, and technological incentives fueled the rapid adoption of surgical robotics across the U.S. and abroad. Cleared by the FDA in 2000 for general laparoscopic procedures - operations performed through small incisions using slender instruments and a camera - da Vinci transformed possibilities for minimally invasive surgery. The robot’s articulated instruments restored the dexterity lost in traditional laparoscopic tools by mimicking the rotation of a human wrist, while its stereoscopic camera provided a magnified, three-dimensional view of the operative field. Together, these features gave surgeons unprecedented precision in confined anatomical spaces."

A high-level planner issues task-level directives in plain language, such as “expose Calot’s triangle,” an anatomical landmark near the gallbladder’s ducts, or “apply clip to duct.” Low-level controllers then translate those commands into precise movements of robotic arms and tools using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms that map each instruction to corresponding motor actions. The separation mirrors how people operate: first reasoning through what must be done, then executing it physically."

Surgeons can observe the planner’s language-based instructions and understand what the robot intends to do, offering a degree of transparency uncommon in machine-learning systems. When unexpected situations arise, such as tissue dyed red to simulate bleeding, or an organ shifted into a different orientation, SRT-H relies on stereo cameras and real-time vision sensors that continuously track the operative field. When these sensors detect a deviation beyond a set tolerance, the high-level planner automatically replans the next movement or issues a corrective micro-adjustment, such as “shift gripper slightly right,” allowing the workflow to continue rather than freezing mid-procedure."

In published studies, it achieved step-level autonomy - that is, independence across a sequence of surgical steps rather than a single repeated motion - during the clipping and cutting phase of a cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) on ex vivo (outside-the-body) pig tissue. Across eight trials, the robot completed the sequence without human intervention, achieving 100 percent success. While not yet capable of a full cholecystectomy, this demonstration marked the first time a system achieved autonomous control across multiple surgical subtasks rather than a single isolated skill."

By training across such varied datasets, a foundation model could, in principle, generalize surgical knowledge across tasks and platforms, adapting flexibly to new operating conditions."
