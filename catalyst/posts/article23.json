      "excerpt": "Rebecca Katz’s plan to volunteer in India was unraveled by a severe illness that doctors in the U.S. struggled to diagnose. After eight months, they found the cause: a rare pathogen once weaponized by the U.S. military. The surreal experience would change everything, leading her to become an expert on her own disease and discover a new calling at the intersection of public health and national security.",

Raised in a family deeply rooted in public health, dinner table conversations didn’t revolve around investment banking or law school applications, but instead around health, equity, and the medical systems that shape people’s lives."

For eight months, she remained sick while medical teams searched for answers. Ultimately, they discovered she had contracted a rare pathogen that had once been weaponized by the U.S. military in the 1950s as part of its former offensive biological weapons program."

Her experience gave her a uniquely visceral connection to the subject. With a background in policy, economics, and epidemiology, she saw a new convergence of disciplines: national security and global health."

Most schools didn’t quite know what to make of her proposal, but Katz pushed forward, undeterred. Eventually, a former dean from her program at Yale, who had now moved to Princeton, encouraged her to pursue her graduate studies within their School of Public and International Affairs (formerly the Woodrow Wilson School). There, Katz had the opportunity to combine courses in Epidemiology and National Security, and would soon be writing about biological weapons as a public health threat — inadvertently submitting one of her exam papers on September 10, 2001."

At the policy level, Katz collaborated with ministries of health and foreign affairs in countries such as Uganda, India, and Jordan, helping to design and evaluate pandemic preparedness plans, infectious disease reporting systems, and public health emergency operations centers. Her advisory work has also extended to the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), where she has supported the design of the program. "

In 2005, a former mentor encouraged her to lecture in his course at the George Washington University (GWU) School of Medicine. Lecturing led to more interactions with the GWU faculty, and soon the School of Public Health — now the Milken Institute School of Public Health — soon offered Katz a faculty position. There, she continued her work at the intersection of epidemiology and national security, ultimately receiving a prestigious K Award from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to support her research."
