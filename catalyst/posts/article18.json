        "content": "Tyler Wyka (GWU SEAS BS ‘24, MS ‘25) stands at the crossroads of engineering, sustainability, and global change. As a Mechanical Engineering graduate student at George Washington University, his work spans the technical frontiers of decarbonizing energy systems while fostering international collaborations that address the pressing challenges of climate change. From his research in the Leblanc Laboratory — where he models the performance of alternative fuels in aero-derivative gas turbines — to his hands-on efforts helping communities build climate-resilient infrastructure in Sierra Leone, Wyka embodies the modern engineer: a connector of disciplines, a catalyst for innovation, and an advocate for pragmatic change. His journey, shaped by curiosity, collaboration, and a commitment to impact, continues to inspire a new generation of engineers to embrace a broader responsibility—not just to advance technology, but to create a future worth building."

As a young teenager, Wyka’s favorite activities involved watching science documentaries and reading, usually focusing on space exploration or the cosmos. At age 13, Wyka attended a viewing of a Hubble Space Telescope documentary at the Jersey City Liberty Science Center. Amazed at the starry imagery and the vast depths of the universe, Wyka felt a newfound gratitude for the Earth’s existence in the cosmos, he said, and left the theater inspired."

Through his experience constructing wings and analyzing flight patterns, Wyka began to envision his future at a company like NASA or SpaceX, he said, where he could achieve his lifelong dream of helping humanity reach beyond the stars. Somewhere along the way, however, he had an epiphany—one that would alter his trajectory. He realized that while the cosmos may be a vast and untapped domain, the true miracle wasn’t beyond the atmosphere; it was here, on Earth. The planet itself, a delicate and improbable oasis in the cold expanse of the universe, would be a much more rewarding problem to work on, he said."

He joined the Leblanc Laboratory in 2021, where he worked on energy systems optimization research. But he didn’t stop there—science alone wouldn’t help the world’s problems. To drive meaningful change, it was essential to align policy, industry, and public perception. He took his knowledge beyond the lab, working with the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) to influence how institutions and industries approached energy transitions. From 2023 to 2024, Wyka helped lead a team of multidisciplinary students to compete in the Solar District Cup national competition hosted by NREL. The competition focused on developing a three-part plan that included policy, finance, and design, demonstrating the integrative nature of climate work."

He contacted and began a relationship with the Forum for Agriculture, Innovation and Empowerment for Children and Youth in Sierra Leone (FAIECY-SL) to learn about the struggles of those most impacted by the global climate crisis and how to help. FAIECY-SL, founded in 2020, is a youth-led organization working on climate resilience infrastructure and ecological innovation. After winning a grant from the Charitable Foundation of the Energy Bar Association (CFEBA) — a D.C.-based NGO focused on energy-related projects — Wyka and FAIECY-SL joined forces to construct solar drying huts in rural communities of Sierra Leone, allowing communities to effectively preserve their harvests."

He incorporates Cantera, an open-source combustion simulation tool, to analyze fuel consumption, power output, and emissions. By validating his model against Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, he bridges the gap between theory and practice, ensuring that his research has real-world applications, he said."

        "content": "Wyka’s findings will support decarbonization research for the broader marine transport sector, which, if it were a country, falls directly behind China, the U.S., India, the E.U., and Russia in its production of greenhouse gas emissions. If these alternative fuels prove viable, they could accelerate the maritime industry’s transition to cleaner energy sources. Overall, climate research can affect numerous areas and necessitates a broad synthesis of engineering expertise, a commitment to sustainability, and an ability to apply cutting-edge technology to real-world problems. Wyka exemplifies how working on climate change is not a simple fix, but rather a complex web of interconnected issues in almost every field of study."
