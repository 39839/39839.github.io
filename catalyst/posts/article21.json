This lab researches the neurocognitive bases of language and memory. While earning his doctorate in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the early 1990s, Dr. Ullman proposed the declarative/procedural (DP) model. This theoretical framework provides key insights into the neural bases of language learning and use. His work is widely cited and has applications in studying the neurocognition of language, memory, and other cognitive domains."

My best friend’s father in San Francisco was an early geneticist. I thought, ‘Oh, genetics would be cool,’” he shared. He initially majored in biochemistry at Harvard. However, he later realized that working in a lab with Petri dishes wasn't his passion."

When he returned to Harvard, Dr. Ullman switched his major to computer science, focusing on cognitive science and language. He hoped to use this knowledge to launch another company, this time in machine translation."

        "content": "As Dr. Ullman delved deeper into science, he decided to pursue a Ph.D. at MIT. There, he studied language under the mentorship of Dr. Steven Pinker, a renowned psychologist in psycholinguistics. Although he appreciated his mentor’s cognitive approach to language, Dr. Ullman was intrigued by the neurobiological mechanisms behind it. With guidance from Dr. Pinker and Dr. Suzanne Corkin, he began studying patients with neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. These disorders primarily impaired different brain regions, offering a unique window into how language is processed neurologically. During this research, he developed the DP model."

He stated, “Grammatical deficits may be due to problems with underlying procedural memory; lexical deficits with declarative memory.” He recognized that as observational patterns aligned with the characteristic patterns of neurodegeneration in both diseases. Alzheimer’s involves degeneration in the temporal lobe structures, which relate to declarative memory, while Parkinson’s affects the basal ganglia, associated with procedural memory. "

Dr. Ullman’s research reveals the interconnectedness between these systems. The DP model elucidates not only how the brain processes language but also how we can learn more effectively. Through understanding how we think, we also come to appreciate the evolution of our brain's functions. Whether memorizing metabolic pathways in biochemistry or synthesis reactions in organic chemistry, the brain constantly utilizes both declarative and procedural memory systems to comprehend the world. Dr. Ullman’s work advances our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying these functionalities, benefiting neuroscientists, psychologists, educators, and students alike."
