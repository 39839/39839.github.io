        "content": "Dr. Adam’s work focuses on developing “memristors,” which she describes as resistors with memory to recall how much charge they’ve passed. Meanwhile, traditional computers process information using a rigid structure of transistors and binary code of zeroes and ones. Although this approach has worked thus far, it is less effective with higher-complexity tasks like pattern recognition and real-time learning, and when it does attempt those complex tasks, it consumes vast amounts of energy. This limitation lies in how the transistors use sequential processing for information. Imagine that a large image is placed in front of someone. As soon as their eyes see it, the brain processes the information on several tracks — an ability called parallel processing — such that the experience stimulates pathways that evoke feelings from the amygdala, perception in the occipital cortex, and memory recall in the hippocampus. Transistors, however, must process each pixel one by one, requiring extensive time and energy."

        "content": "The key to a memristor’s memory lies in resistive switching, which is typically achieved through ion migration or phase changes in the material. The most common way scientists use them to “remember information” is through ion migration, which occurs when an applied voltage creates or fills oxygen vacancies (missing atoms) of metal oxides such as titanium dioxide or hafnium oxide inside the memristor, creating new conductive pathways or removing old ones, effectively “encoding” a retained memory state even after the current information is terminated. Unlike binary logic, memristors can process a range of values, enabling them to perform parallelized tasks like image and speech recognition. "

        "content": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease affecting roughly 2.8 million people worldwide, according to the National MS Society in 2019. Over time, the disease causes progressive nerve damage, physical disability, and cognitive decline. Despite decades of research, scientists have struggled to develop effective treatments capable of repairing years’ worth of nerve damage. Dr. Jeffrey Huang, an Associate Professor of Biology at Georgetown University, is spearheading innovative research that may offer hope for MS patients in the nation’s capital."

        "content": "A hallmark feature of MS that underlies many of its symptoms is the demyelination of neurons. Like a computer, the neurons of the brain and spinal cord use electricity to communicate with one another and mediate quick information processing. In order to maximize their communication speed, many neuronal fibers are insulated by myelin sheaths, a fatty layer of Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes that wrap themselves along the axons and prevent ions from diffusing out, maximizing their current speed. In MS, the immune system wrongly attacks and destroys these myelin, impairing neuronal communication drastically. Dr. Huang studies remyelination — the process of repairing these protective myelin sheaths — and his discoveries in neuroinflammation and brain repair mechanisms have paved the way for new therapies and redefined our prior understanding of the brain’s innate ability to heal itself.

        "content": "Many of the symptoms observed in MS, such as muscle weakness, impaired coordination of movements, and vision problems, result from the slowed signaling that occurs upon loss of myelin. Moreover, the high energy required for the neurons to communicate following the loss of the myelin sheaths makes them especially vulnerable to a process called excitotoxicity, which causes neuronal death."

        "content": "Current treatments mainly focus on suppressing the immune response, which helps to slow the progression of MS, but does not address the underlying demyelination issue. Some of Dr. Huang’s most significant contributions to MS research elucidate the crucial role of microglia, the brain’s resident immune cell, in clearing damaged myelin and promoting its repair. His research shows that when appropriately activated, microglia release cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that support the maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, enabling them to produce myelin and repair some of the nerve damage."

Utilizing the compound JPH034, an inhibitor of the LAT1 transporter, the drug effectively reduces the quantity of pro-inflammatory factors that induce microglia to cause damage. As inflammation is relieved, OPCs successfully mature and re-myelinate neurons, essentially repairing the damage caused by the disease."

In fact, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that about 2,088,849 cases of TNBC were recorded in 2018, making it a common cancer in women. TNBC is a particularly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that derives its name from the fact that it lacks the three receptors commonly targeted in breast cancer treatments: estrogen, which controls female sexual and reproductive development, progesterone, which regulates the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and other aspects of reproduction, and HER2, a protein that controls cell growth. The absence of these receptors makes conventional hormonal therapies ineffective in TNBC, leaving patients with minimal options for treatment and a pressing need for innovative approaches."
