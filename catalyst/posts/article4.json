        "content": "More formally, Complexity Science is the study of how large networks of components interact and produce emergent phenomena that are self-organizing. Think of the brain, an extraordinarily complex system, that relies on the interactions of neurons which themselves are simplistic. We can visualize the structure of the neuron under a microscope, and we can understand its molecular components– and yet, to comprehend how such a cell can give rise to what we experience as consciousness– is inexplicable without considering the surrounding system. Complexity Science argues that understanding the interactions between individual parts, enables scientists to unearth hidden information in the system, and form a comprehensive picture of the greater reality."

        "content": "In the public’s eye, the term ‘neural network’ has been synonymous with Artificial Intelligence since the late 2010s revolution in Deep Learning models. The term describes the various connected layers within an algorithm that attempt to mimic the logic of a human brain. The name itself tells the story of complexity at work. Based on the work of Stanford Neurophysiologist, Warren McCollugh, many computer scientists in the 1950s began imitating the structure of the brain, and developed mathematical and computational models that could program machines to perform similar processes. Advancements were made, with one of the biggest leaps occurring when David Rumelhart, a Psychologist developed Propagated Networks, in order to extend the “thinking” to multiple layers of neurons. Now widely recognized as one of the most important advancements in the last few decades, many forget the origins of deep neural networks that helped to develop programs like ChatGPT lay in an entirely different field, illustrating the underlying inspiration that complexity sciences affords.

When taking classes or pursuing minors adjacent to your main field, think about how these topics might connect. Becoming an expert in one field is important, but it is likewise valuable to foment a basic understanding for surrounding disciplines."

Public Health students don't shy away from topics like chemistry or physics."

Economics, Music, International Affairs and Media Studies all uncover thought provoking answers to the questions of Complexity. How can the growth of cities mirror the migration of birds? How does the volatility weather patterns help predict the rise of certain stocks? Complexity Science urges us to view each of these unique subjects as part of a greater whole; as students with the opportunity to expand our breadth of knowledge, look for ways to form a more comprehensive picture of our world, by engaging with a range of disciplines."

Many problems that appear unsolvable on their surface– the origins of evolution, the cure to cancer, nuclear fusion– may in fact be solvable through cross-pollination over other fields. If anything, Complexity Science commands each of us to step outside our comfort zones and view our work in the light of others’."
